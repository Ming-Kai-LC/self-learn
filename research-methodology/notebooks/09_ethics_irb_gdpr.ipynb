    "## 1. Five Core Ethical Principles in Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern research ethics rests on five foundational principles that guide how we conduct research responsibly. These principles emerged from centuries of ethical thought, from the Hippocratic Oath to the Nuremberg Code and contemporary frameworks like the EU Ethics Guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 1: Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Avoid bias and discrimination; ensure benefits and burdens are distributed equitably across all population groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Practice**:\n",
    "- Regularly audit models for disparate impact across demographic groups\n",
    "- Consider multiple definitions of fairness (they often conflict)\n",
    "- Include diverse representation in data collection and testing\n",
    "- Acknowledge that perfect fairness is impossible; choose fairness metrics intentionally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A hiring algorithm must be tested for equal performance across gender and race. If it has 95% accuracy for men but 78% for women, it violates fairness even if overall accuracy is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 2: Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Make research methods and decision-making processes explainable and understandable to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Practice**:\n",
    "- Document model decisions with LIME, SHAP, or similar explanations\n",
    "- Clearly state limitations and assumptions\n",
    "- Provide plain-language summaries alongside technical details\n",
    "- Enable external auditing and review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A loan approval system should explain to applicants WHY their application was rejected, not just that it was.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 3: Accountability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Clearly assign responsibility for research decisions and impacts; conduct and document impact assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Practice**:\n",
    "- Designate clear roles: who decides, who implements, who verifies?\n",
    "- Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)\n",
    "- Maintain audit trails of all decisions and changes\n",
    "- Plan for remediation if harms are discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: AI/ML teams must document who tested for bias, who signed off on deployment, and how they will respond if bias is discovered post-deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 4: Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Protect personal data through encryption, access controls, and purpose limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Practice**:\n",
    "- Encrypt data at rest and in transit\n",
    "- Implement role-based access controls\n",
    "- De-identify data when possible\n",
    "- Limit data use to stated purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A medical research study collects health data for cardiovascular research. Using the same data to study genetic predispositions without explicit new consent violates privacy principles (purpose limitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 5: Beneficence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Maximize benefits while minimizing potential harms to research participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Practice**:\n",
    "- Conduct risk-benefit analyses before research begins\n",
    "- Design studies to answer important questions\n",
    "- Implement safeguards to protect vulnerable populations\n",
    "- Share results transparently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A machine learning model deployed in healthcare must reduce diagnostic errors more than it creates new mistakes. The benefits must justify any harms from occasional errors."

    "## 2. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that reviews and approves research involving human subjects. Understanding when IRB review is required is crucial for research compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Requires IRB Review?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research** that involves:\n",
    "1. **Human subjects**: Any living person\n",
    "2. **Interventions or interactions**: Deliberate manipulation, observation, or engagement\n",
    "3. **Private identifiable information**: PII that could identify individuals\n",
    "4. **Generalizable knowledge**: Results intended to be shared or published\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example requiring review**: Survey of 100 customers about product preferences (involves subjects, interaction, and intent to publish)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example NOT requiring review**: Analysis of pre-existing anonymized dataset with no human contact\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exemption Categories (45 CFR 46.101(b))\n",
    "\n",
    "Some research can be **exempt** from full IRB review if it meets specific criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Description | Typical Examples |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| (1) | Educational settings; normal educational practices | Classroom surveys, teaching experiments |\n",
    "| (2) | Educational tests, surveys, interviews (if anonymous) | Anonymous customer satisfaction surveys |\n",
    "| (3) | Existing data analysis (secondary data) | Analysis of published datasets |\n",
    "| (4) | Quality improvement projects | Internal process improvements |\n",
    "| (5) | Public benefit/service programs | Evaluation of government programs |\n",
    "| (6) | Taste/consumer acceptance studies | Food/beverage preference studies |\n",
    "| (7) | Certain foreign research | International studies with local ethics approval |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Levels of Review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exempt**: No IRB review required (but must be carefully evaluated)\n",
    "- Low risk to subjects\n",
    "- No sensitive data\n",
    "- Minimal burden on subjects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expedited**: Streamlined review (45 days typical)\n",
    "- Minimal risk projects\n",
    "- Amendments to approved research\n",
    "- Continuing review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Board**: Complete committee review (typically 60+ days)\n",
    "- More than minimal risk\n",
    "- Vulnerable populations (children, prisoners, pregnant women)\n",
    "- Sensitive topics"

    "- **Goal**: Clean biased training data\n",
    "- **Techniques**:\n",
    "  - Oversampling underrepresented groups\n",

    "  - Removing biased features (redlining attributes)\n",
    "  - Improving data representation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-processing (During Model Training)\n",
    "- **Goal**: Train model with fairness constraints\n",
    "- **Techniques**:\n",

    "## Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Five Core Ethical Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Fairness**: Systematically audit for bias; track disparate impact metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Transparency**: Explain model decisions to stakeholders; document assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Accountability**: Assign clear responsibility; maintain audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Privacy**: Implement privacy by design; enforce GDPR compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Beneficence**: Balance benefits and harms; protect vulnerable populations\n",
    "\n",
    "### IRB Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ IRB review required when research involves **human subjects + intervention/interaction + PII**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Exemption categories exist (secondary analysis of de-identified data)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Three review levels: Exempt → Expedited → Full Board (by risk level)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Different standards apply globally (GDPR in EU, Common Rule in US)\n",
    "\n",
    "### GDPR Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Applies to any organization processing EEA residents' data\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous, revocable\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Privacy by design: minimize, encrypt, access control, retention limits\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Violating GDPR costs up to €20M or 4% of global revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias Detection and Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Multiple fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds) capture different aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Three stages: pre-processing (data), in-processing (training), post-processing (predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Fairness metrics often conflict; choose the right definition for your use case\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Regular auditing and monitoring are essential ongoing practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use ethical checklists before deployment (like the examples in Exercises 1-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Document all ethical decisions and trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Build diverse teams; include affected stakeholders in decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Plan for monitoring bias and harms post-deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Remember: ethical research is not about perfect solutions, but thoughtful choices"
