    "## 1. Understanding Literature Review Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Landscape of Literature Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "Literature reviews are systematic approaches to summarizing, synthesizing, and critically evaluating existing research on a topic. However, not all reviews are created equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key principle**: The type of review you conduct should match your research question and the state of the evidence base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Main Review Types\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Systematic Review | Scoping Review | Narrative Review |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Purpose** | Answer specific question with high evidence | Map evidence landscape and identify gaps | Explore broad/emerging topics |\n",
    "| **Scope** | Narrow, focused research question (PICO) | Broad exploratory question (PCC) | Flexible, author-determined |\n",
    "| **Rigor** | Highest - standardized, transparent | High - structured methodology | Lower - interpretive approach |\n",
    "| **Time** | 1-3 years | 6-12 months | 2-6 months |\n",
    "| **Search** | Comprehensive (multiple databases) | Structured 3-step strategy | Ad-hoc or expert selection |\n",
    "| **Analysis** | Meta-analysis possible | Thematic synthesis | Integrative synthesis |\n",
    "| **Team** | Large team required | 2-3 researchers | Often single author |\n",
    "| **Registration** | PROSPERO required | Recommended | Not required |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Choose Each Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose SYSTEMATIC REVIEW when:**\n",
    "- You have a narrow, well-defined research question\n",
    "- You need the highest level of evidence\n",
    "- Enough high-quality studies exist on the topic\n",
    "- You want to inform policy or clinical practice\n",
    "- You need to quantitatively combine results (meta-analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose SCOPING REVIEW when:**\n",
    "- Your research question is broad or exploratory\n",
    "- You want to map what evidence exists\n",
    "- You need to identify evidence gaps and research priorities\n",
    "- The evidence base is heterogeneous or immature\n",
    "- You're planning a future systematic review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose NARRATIVE REVIEW when:**\n",
    "- You're exploring an emerging or highly specialized topic\n",
    "- Limited primary research exists\n",
    "- You need critical interpretation and expert judgment\n",
    "- You're synthesizing theory and empirical evidence\n",
    "- You want to provide context and historical perspective"

    "\n",
    "### What is PRISMA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**PRISMA** = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2020 update (PRISMA 2020) provides:\n",
    "- 27-item checklist for reporting\n",
    "- 8 tables and figures for presenting results\n",
    "- Guidance for transparency and reproducibility\n",
    "- Extensions for specific review types\n",
    "\n",
    "### PICO Framework: Structuring Your Review Question\n",
    "\n",
    "PICO is used to structure systematic review questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P (Population)**: Who is the study about?\n",
    "  - Example: \"Patients with type 2 diabetes aged 40-70\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **I (Intervention)**: What is being done?\n",
    "  - Example: \"Long-acting insulin therapy\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **C (Comparison)**: What is it compared to?\n",
    "  - Example: \"Standard short-acting insulin regimen\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **O (Outcome)**: What is measured/evaluated?\n",
    "  - Example: \"Hemoglobin A1c levels, hypoglycemic episodes, quality of life\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### PROSPERO Registration\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting your systematic review:\n",
    "1. Register your protocol in PROSPERO (CRD at University of York)\n",
    "2. Document your methods and analysis plan BEFORE analyzing data\n",
    "3. Prevents \"research question drift\" (changing questions based on results)\n",
    "4. Ensures transparency and reduces bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk of Bias Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding studies, assess quality using standardized tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Randomized Controlled Trials: RoB 2**\n",
    "- Bias from randomization process\n",
    "- Bias due to deviations from intended interventions\n",
    "- Bias due to missing outcome data\n",
    "- Bias in measurement of outcome\n",
    "- Bias in selection of reported results\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Non-Randomized Studies: ROBINS-I**\n",
    "- Includes assessment of confounding and selection bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Certainty of Evidence: GRADE\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate evidence quality across four domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High**: Further research very unlikely to change confidence in effect\n",
    "2. **Moderate**: Further research likely to impact confidence in effect\n",
    "3. **Low**: Further research very likely to impact confidence\n",
    "4. **Very Low**: Estimate may be substantially different from true effect\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is a Scoping Review?\n",
    "\n",
    "A scoping review is a rigorous and transparent method for mapping evidence in a topic area, identifying:\n",
    "- What research has been done\n",
    "- What evidence exists\n",
    "- Where gaps exist\n",
    "- Where future research is needed\n",

    "- 3-step search process:\n",
    "  1. Initial search (limited sources) to identify keywords/phrases\n",
    "  2. Second search (multiple databases) with refined terms\n",
    "  3. Citation searching in selected articles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 3: Study selection and data extraction**\n",
    "- Clearly defined inclusion/exclusion criteria\n",
    "- Usually single reviewer (vs systematic reviews' dual review)\n",
    "- Standardized data extraction tool\n",
    "- Does NOT assess methodological quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 4: Chart the data**\n",
    "- Present characteristics of included studies\n",
    "- Extract meaningful data to answer research question\n",
    "- Create evidence mapping tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 5: Collate, summarize, and report**\n",
    "- Thematic analysis of findings\n",

    "   - Explain why systematic review wasn't appropriate\n",
    "   - Document the decision-making process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Be transparent about search strategy**\n",
    "   - Document which databases searched\n",
    "   - Report search terms used\n",
    "   - Acknowledge limitations in search approach\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Critically appraise evidence**\n",
    "   - Don't treat all sources as equally valid\n",
    "   - Distinguish between empirical studies, opinion pieces, theory\n",
    "   - Use explicit criteria for evaluating quality\n",

    "## 7. Meta-Analysis Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Meta-Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meta-analysis** is the statistical technique of combining results from multiple independent studies to produce an overall estimate of effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Perform Meta-Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta-analysis is appropriate when:\n",
    "1. **Multiple studies** exist on the same topic (usually ≥3)\n",
    "2. **Similar populations** and interventions across studies\n",
    "3. **Comparable outcomes** measured in similar ways\n",
    "4. **Similar methodological quality** (or quality differences assessed)\n",
    "5. **Lack of high heterogeneity** (studies don't conflict dramatically)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Do Meta-Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Too few studies (fewer than 3-5)\n",
    "❌ Highly different populations or interventions\n",
    "❌ Outcomes measured differently across studies\n",
    "❌ Extreme quality differences\n",
    "❌ High heterogeneity indicating conflicting results\n",
    "❌ Only one study of adequate quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Meta-Analysis Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect Size**\n",
    "- Standardized measure of intervention effectiveness\n",
    "- Common metrics: Odds Ratio (OR), Relative Risk (RR), Mean Difference (MD)\n",
    "- Allows comparison across studies with different measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heterogeneity (I²)**\n",
    "- Measures variability between studies beyond what's expected by chance\n",
    "- I² = 0%: No heterogeneity (results consistent)\n",
    "- I² = 25-50%: Low heterogeneity\n",
    "- I² = 50-75%: Moderate heterogeneity\n",
    "- I² = 75-100%: High heterogeneity (conflicting results)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed vs Random Effects Models**\n",
    "- **Fixed effects**: Assumes all variation is due to sampling error\n",
    "  - Use when heterogeneity is low (I² < 30%)\n",
    "  - Gives narrower confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random effects**: Accounts for between-study variation\n",
    "  - Use when heterogeneity is present\n",
    "  - More conservative (wider confidence intervals)\n",
    "  - Recommended for most healthcare reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publication Bias**\n",
    "- Studies with positive results more likely to be published\n",
    "- Meta-analysis may overestimate true effect\n",
    "- Assessed using funnel plots and statistical tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forest Plot Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **forest plot** is the standard visualization for meta-analysis:\n",
    "- Each horizontal line = one study's effect size with confidence interval\n",
    "- Diamond at bottom = overall pooled effect\n",
    "- Vertical line at 1.0 = null effect (no difference)\n",
    "- If confidence interval crosses 1.0 → Not statistically significant"
