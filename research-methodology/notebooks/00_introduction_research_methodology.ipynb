    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Methodology** = The overall philosophical framework and strategy for conducting research\n",
    "- Example: \"We used an experimental methodology with randomized controlled trials\"\n",
    "- It answers: *What is the overall approach and why?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method** = The specific technique or procedure used to collect/analyze data\n",
    "- Example: \"We used surveys and interviews as data collection methods\"\n",
    "- It answers: *What specific tools did you use?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique** = The detailed steps within a method\n",
    "- Example: \"We used stratified random sampling as our sampling technique\"\n",
    "- It answers: *How exactly did you apply the method?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Methodology Matters in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Research methodology is the **systematic framework** that guides how you:\n",
    "1. Formulate research questions\n",
    "2. Design studies and experiments\n",
    "3. Collect and manage data\n",
    "4. Analyze results validly\n",
    "5. Draw sound conclusions\n",
    "6. Ensure reproducibility\n",

    "- A Princeton study found reproducibility failures in 41 papers across 30 fields\n",
    "- These failures affected **648 other papers** that built on the flawed research\n",
    "- Nature's 2016 survey: 70% of researchers couldn't reproduce others' experiments\n",

    "**Example 2: Data Leakage Disasters**\n",
    "- Medical diagnosis model claimed 99% accuracy\n",
    "- Problem: Test data was included in training preprocessing\n",
    "- Real-world accuracy: 65% (dangerous for patient care!)\n",

    "1. **Solving the Wrong Problem**\n",
    "   - Building technically correct solutions to misunderstood questions\n",
    "   - Prevention: Deep stakeholder engagement, clear problem formulation\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Using information from test data during training\n",
    "   - Prevention: Split data FIRST, fit preprocessing only on training data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confusing Correlation and Causation**\n",
    "   - Claiming X causes Y based only on correlation\n",
    "   - Prevention: Causal diagrams, randomized experiments, domain expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overfitting**\n",
    "   - Model performs well on training data but fails on new data\n",
    "   - Prevention: Cross-validation, regularization, simpler models\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **P-Hacking / Multiple Comparisons**\n",
    "   - Testing many hypotheses and reporting only significant ones\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Research methodology** is the systematic framework guiding rigorous data science research\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Methodology ≠ Method ≠ Technique** - these are different levels of abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **The scientific method** provides a time-tested framework: observe, question, hypothesize, experiment, analyze, conclude, communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Falsifiability** is essential - good hypotheses must be testable and potentially disprovable\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Exploratory analysis** generates hypotheses; **rigorous research** tests them\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Common pitfalls** (data leakage, p-hacking, correlation≠causation) have methodological solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Reproducibility requires** proper methodology from the start, not as an afterthought\n",
    "\n",
