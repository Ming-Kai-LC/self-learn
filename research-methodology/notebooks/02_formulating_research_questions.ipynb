    "## 3. From Questions to Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hypothesis** is an **educated prediction** about the relationship between variables. It's a testable statement derived from your research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics of a good hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Based on theory or prior research** - Not just a random guess\n",
    "2. **Specifies variables clearly** - Independent and dependent variables named\n",
    "3. **Predicts a direction** - Says how variables relate (positive/negative/difference)\n",
    "4. **Testable through falsification** - Can be proven false with data\n",
    "5. **Singular relationship** - Tests one relationship at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Naming Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical testing, hypotheses are formally stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**H₀ (Null Hypothesis)**: The \"default\" assumption - no relationship, no effect, no difference\n",
    "- \"There is NO relationship between employee tenure and customer satisfaction\"\n",
    "- \"The new algorithm has NO better accuracy than the baseline\"\n",
    "- \"Product A and Product B have NO different conversion rates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis)**: What you're trying to demonstrate - there IS a relationship/effect\n",
    "- \"There IS a relationship between employee tenure and customer satisfaction\"\n",
    "- \"The new algorithm has BETTER accuracy than the baseline\"\n",
    "- \"Product A has a DIFFERENT conversion rate than Product B\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical testing works by:\n",
    "1. **Assuming H₀ is true** (no effect)\n",
    "2. **Calculating probability** of observing your data IF H₀ were true (p-value)\n",
    "3. **Rejecting H₀** only if p-value is very small (typically p < 0.05)\n",
    "4. **Supporting H₁** if H₀ is rejected\n",
    "\nThis is called **hypothesis testing** and is the foundation of statistical inference."

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Research questions** are the foundation - specific, answerable, and focused\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Four types of questions** build in complexity:\n",
    "   - Descriptive: \"What is?\"\n",
    "   - Exploratory: \"Why is?\"\n",
    "   - Predictive: \"What will?\"\n",
    "   - Prescriptive: \"What should?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Hypotheses** are testable predictions with:\n",
    "   - Null hypothesis (H₀): Default assumption of no effect\n",
    "   - Alternative hypothesis (H₁): What you're trying to demonstrate\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Operationalization** converts abstract concepts to measurable variables:\n",
    "   - Enables empirical testing\n",
    "   - Ensures replicability\n",
    "   - Must be valid and reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **All three elements must align**:\n",
    "   - Question → Hypothesis → Operationalization → Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good research design** requires careful thinking at the planning stage, not just statistical analysis\n",
