    "\n",
    "The most important decision in planning research is choosing between:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experimental Design** - The researcher manipulates variables\n",
    "2. **Observational Design** - The researcher observes naturally occurring variation\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice determines:\n",
    "- What causal claims you can make\n",
    "- How many resources you need\n",
    "- What ethical constraints apply\n",
    "- How strong your evidence will be\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristic**: The researcher *controls* and *manipulates* the independent variable(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this enables**:\n",
    "- Making causal claims with confidence\n",
    "- Isolating specific effects\n",
    "- Controlling confounding variables\n",
    "- Replicating conditions precisely\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it requires**:\n",
    "- Ability to assign participants/units to conditions\n",
    "- Ethical approval (sometimes)\n",
    "- Controlled environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Testing whether a new website design improves user engagement by randomly assigning visitors to current (control) or new (treatment) design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observational Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristic**: The researcher *observes* naturally occurring variation without manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When it's necessary**:\n",
    "- Randomization is unethical (e.g., smoking effects)\n",
    "- Long time horizons (decades of follow-up)\n",
    "- Rare outcomes (waiting for events to occur naturally)\n",
    "- Studying existing policies or phenomena\n",
    "\n",
    "**The challenge**: Causal inference from observational data requires careful statistical work\n",

    "## 2. Core Principles of Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Rigorous experimental design rests on three fundamental principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 1: Randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Eliminate systematic bias in assigning units to treatment conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**: Each unit has an equal probability of receiving each treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**:\n",
    "- Distributes confounding variables equally across groups\n",
    "- Creates comparable groups except for the treatment\n",
    "- Enables statistical inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different randomization approaches**:\n",
    "- **Simple random assignment**: Each unit independently assigned with fixed probability\n",
    "- **Stratified randomization**: Randomize within subgroups, then combine\n",
    "- **Block randomization**: Ensure equal group sizes in blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 2: Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Observe the effect across multiple units to reduce noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types**:\n",
    "1. **Within-experiment replication**: Multiple observations per condition\n",
    "2. **Across-experiment replication**: Repeating the entire experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**:\n",
    "- Larger sample sizes → more precise estimates\n",
    "- Allows assessment of statistical significance\n",
    "- Reduces impact of random variation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 3: Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Hold constant variables that might affect outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**:\n",
    "1. **Holding variables constant**: Use identical conditions for all units\n",
    "2. **Matching**: Pair similar units, give different treatments\n",
    "3. **Blocking**: Group similar units, randomize treatments within groups\n",
    "4. **Statistical adjustment**: Use covariates in analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Reduces noise, makes effects clearer, increases statistical power"

    "✅ **Experimental vs Observational** - Experiments enable causal claims; observational studies are necessary when randomization isn't feasible\n",

    "- Factorial designs for multiple factors\n",
    "- Blocked designs to control known confounders\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Observational Studies** - Can be strengthened through matching, regression adjustment, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Hierarchy of Evidence** - Different designs provide different levels of evidence; systematic reviews are strongest, expert opinion weakest\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Statistical Power** - Essential planning tool; larger samples, larger effects, and better designs increase power\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Trade-offs Exist** - Strong causal evidence vs practical feasibility, internal validity vs external validity"
