    "\n",
    "**Title**: \"Effect of Personalized Email Recommendations on Customer Engagement and Retention: A Randomized Controlled Trial\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**:\n",
    "Customer churn costs the e-commerce industry $89 billion annually (Statista, 2023). Current email engagement strategies use static, one-size-fits-all messaging, resulting in 40% average open rates and 2% click rates. We propose that personalized recommendations based on browsing behavior and purchase history will significantly increase engagement and reduce churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Gap**:\n",
    "While personalization is known to improve engagement (Smith et al., 2021), no randomized controlled trial has tested personalized recommendations vs. control in the mid-market e-commerce segment. Our contribution addresses this gap with a robust experimental design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1**: Does personalized email recommendation increase customer engagement (measured by open rate, click rate, and conversion rate) compared to control messaging?\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1**: Customers receiving personalized recommendations will have 25% higher email open rates, 50% higher click rates, and 30% higher conversion rates compared to control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2**: Is the effect of personalization sustained over time or does it decay?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type**: Randomized controlled trial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Allocation**: 50% treatment (personalized), 50% control (static template)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration**: 12 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample**: N = 100,000 active customers, stratified random allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Outcome**: Email open rate after 2 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Outcomes**: Click rate, conversion rate, 30-day retention\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power Analysis**:\n",
    "- Assumed control open rate: 40%\n",
    "- Effect size (treatment increase): 25% → 50% open rate\n",
    "- Power: 95%, α = 0.05 (two-tailed)\n",

    "- **Planned sample N = 100,000 (well-powered for secondary outcomes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Analysis**:\n",

    "**Sensitivity Analyses**:\n",
    "- Per-protocol analysis (accounting for email non-delivery)\n",
    "- Heterogeneous treatment effects by customer segment\n",
    "- Different email send time optimization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code repository**: GitHub (public after publication)\n",
    "- **Pre-registration**: OSF before analysis (Registered Report)\n",
    "- **Data sharing**: Anonymized sample of 10,000 observations\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Complete codebook, data dictionary, analysis scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informed consent**: Implicit in terms of service, email privacy policy updated\n",
    "- **Risk mitigation**: Control group receives quality email (not harmful), can opt-out\n",
    "- **Regulatory**: Complies with CAN-SPAM and GDPR requirements\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Results published regardless of outcome\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**:\n",
    "Our enterprise product has 45% contract non-renewal rate. While we know feature gaps exist, we don't understand *why* customers struggle to adopt. Existing quantitative surveys show satisfaction=7/10 but don't explain underlying frustrations. This qualitative study aims to uncover adoption barriers from customer perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Gap**:\n",
    "Enterprise SaaS adoption literature focuses on large-scale implementations. Small-to-medium enterprise contexts are understudied, particularly regarding implementation blockers beyond feature sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ1**: What are the primary barriers to successful product adoption in small-to-medium enterprises?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ2**: How do these barriers differ across organizational structures, industries, and implementation approaches?\n",

    "1. Initial coding: Line-by-line coding of first 5-8 interviews\n",

    "- **Data**: Anonymized interview transcripts available (with participant consent)\n",

    "#### 7. Credibility and Rigor\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prolonged engagement**: Multiple contacts with each organization (kick-off, mid-point, post-implementation)\n",
    "- **Member checking**: Share preliminary findings with 5 representative participants for feedback\n",
    "- **Triangulation**: Cross-check interview data against usage analytics and support tickets\n",
    "- **Negative case analysis**: Actively seek cases that don't fit emerging theory, revise accordingly\n",
