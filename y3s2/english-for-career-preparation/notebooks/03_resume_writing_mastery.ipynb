    "- Use standard section headings: \"Work Experience\", \"Education\", \"Skills\"\n",
    "- Use simple, clean fonts: Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman (10-12pt)\n",
    "- Save as .docx or .pdf (check job posting for preferred format)\n",
    "- Use standard bullet points (•)\n",
    "- Left-align all text\n",
    "- Use single-column layout\n",
    "- Include phone number with country code (+60)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Use tables, text boxes, or columns\n",
    "- Add headers and footers (ATS may not read them)\n",
    "- Use images, graphics, or logos\n",
    "- Use fancy fonts or colors\n",
    "- Use creative section names (\"My Journey\" instead of \"Work Experience\")\n",
    "- Submit as .jpg, .png, or .pages files\n",

    "- **Action words**: \"Develop\", \"Manage\", \"Lead\"\n",

    "## 5. Common Resume Mistakes That Lead to Rejection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Spelling and Grammar Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**: 58% of resumes with typos are immediately rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Experiance in Python programming\"\n",
    "- \"Recieved Employee of the Month award\"\n",
    "- \"Worked closely with client's to deliver projects\" (incorrect apostrophe)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution:**\n",
    "- Use spell-check (Grammarly, MS Word)\n",
    "- Read resume aloud to catch errors\n",
    "- Ask someone else to proofread\n",
    "- Wait 24 hours and proofread again with fresh eyes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Including Irrelevant Information\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't Include:**\n",
    "- \"Hobbies: Reading, watching movies, playing games\"\n",
    "- Irrelevant work experience (unless you have nothing else)\n",
    "- \"References available upon request\" (this is assumed)\n",
    "- Personal information: age, marital status, religion, photo (unless specifically requested)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Using Passive Language\n",
    "\n",
    "| ❌ Weak (Passive) | ✅ Strong (Active) |\n",
    "|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| \"Was responsible for managing team\" | \"Managed team of 8 developers\" |\n",
    "| \"Involved in website redesign\" | \"Redesigned company website using React\" |\n",
    "| \"Helped to improve sales\" | \"Increased sales by 25% through targeted campaigns\" |\n",
    "| \"Assisted with customer service\" | \"Resolved 50+ customer inquiries daily with 98% satisfaction\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Resume Too Long or Too Short\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal Length:**\n",
    "- **Fresh Graduates**: 1 page (maximum)\n",
    "- **2-10 years experience**: 1-2 pages\n",
    "- **10+ years experience**: 2 pages (maximum)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 5: Poor Formatting and Visual Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad:**\n",
    "- Everything same font size\n",
    "- No white space, text cramped\n",
    "- Inconsistent bullet points\n",
    "- Random bold and italics\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good:**\n",
    "- Name largest (18-24pt)\n",
    "- Section headers bold and slightly larger (12-14pt)\n",
    "- Body text consistent (10-11pt)\n",
    "- Consistent spacing between sections\n",
    "- Margins: 0.5-1 inch on all sides\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 6: Listing Duties Instead of Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Duty-focused (Weak):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "• Managed social media accounts\n",
    "• Posted content regularly\n",
    "• Responded to customer messages\n",
    "```\n",
