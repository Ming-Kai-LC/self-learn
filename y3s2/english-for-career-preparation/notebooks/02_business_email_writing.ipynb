    "┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n",
    "│ 1. SUBJECT LINE                     │  ← Concise, specific, actionable\n",
    "├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n",
    "│ 2. GREETING                         │  ← Professional salutation\n",
    "├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n",
    "│ 3. BODY                             │  ← Main message (purpose, details, action)\n",
    "│    - Opening/Purpose                │\n",
    "│    - Details/Context                │\n",

    "└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component 1: Subject Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject line is **critical** because:\n",
    "- 47% of emails are opened based on subject line alone\n",
    "- It helps recipients prioritize their inbox\n",
    "- It makes emails searchable later\n",

    "|---------------------|---------------------|------|\n",
    "| **Meeting Request: Q4 Budget Review - Oct 25** | \"Meeting\" | Too vague, no details |\n",
    "| **Action Required: Approve Invoice #1234 by Friday** | \"Invoice\" | Missing urgency and specifics |\n",
    "| **Question about Project Timeline - Data Migration** | \"Quick question\" | Unclear topic |\n",
    "| **Thank You - Interview for Software Developer Role** | \"Thanks!\" | Not professional enough |\n",
    "| **Update: Website Launch Delayed to Nov 15** | \"Update\" | Missing critical information |\n",

    "   Example: \"Review Required: Marketing Proposal - Due Oct 20\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[Question] + [Specific Topic]**  \n",
    "   Example: \"Question about API Documentation - Authentication Methods\"\n",

    "3. **[Update/FYI] + [Topic] + [Key Info]**  \n",

    "#### Tips for Greetings\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Do**:\n",
    "- Use a comma (,) after the name in American English\n",
    "- Use a colon (:) in very formal business letters\n",
    "- Check the correct spelling of names (in signature, LinkedIn, company website)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't**:\n",
    "- Use \"Hey\" or \"Yo\" in professional emails\n",

    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- \"As discussed, I have completed the market analysis and attached the report to this email. The key findings show a 15% growth opportunity in the Southeast Asian market. I believe we should prioritize this region in our Q4 strategy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Call to Action (1-2 sentences)\n",

    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Could you please review the attached document and provide your feedback by Friday?\"\n",

    "## 4. Email Etiquette and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 10 Commandments of Professional Email\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rule | Why It Matters | Example |\n",
    "|------|----------------|----------|\n",
    "| **1. Reply within 24 hours** | Shows respect and professionalism | Even if you can't solve the issue, acknowledge receipt |\n",
    "| **2. Use CC and BCC correctly** | Protects privacy, manages information | CC = everyone sees who received it; BCC = hidden recipients |\n",
    "| **3. Proofread before sending** | Errors damage credibility | Use spell-check AND read aloud |\n",
    "| **4. Keep it concise** | Respects recipient's time | Aim for 5 sentences or less when possible |\n",
    "| **5. Use appropriate tone** | Prevents misunderstandings | Avoid sarcasm, jokes, or emotional language |\n",
    "| **6. Include context in replies** | Helps busy recipients remember | When replying to old threads, summarize the topic |\n",
    "| **7. Be careful with Reply All** | Prevents inbox clutter | Only use when everyone needs to see your response |\n",
    "| **8. Use attachments wisely** | Ensures files are received | Mention attachments in the email body, keep under 10MB |\n",
    "| **9. Avoid urgent/high priority flags** | Prevents \"boy who cried wolf\" | Save for true emergencies only |\n",
    "| **10. Re-read before sending** | Catches mistakes and tone issues | Ask: \"Would I want to receive this email?\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use CC vs BCC\n",
    "\n",
    "**CC (Carbon Copy)** - Use when:\n",
    "- Keeping stakeholders informed (e.g., CC your manager on project updates)\n",
    "- You want everyone to know who received the email\n",
    "- All recipients may need to reply or discuss\n",
    "\n",
    "**BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)** - Use when:\n",
    "- Sending to large groups (protects everyone's email addresses)\n",
    "- Privacy is important (recipients shouldn't see each other's emails)\n",
    "- Removing yourself from a long email thread (BCC yourself, ask to be removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ WARNING**: Don't use BCC to secretly copy someone on a conversation - it's considered unethical!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Email Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Start a New Thread vs Continue an Old One\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Continue the thread when:**\n",
    "- Discussing the same topic\n",
    "- Recipients need the previous context\n",
    "- It's been less than a week since the last email\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Start a new thread when:**\n",
    "- The topic has changed significantly\n",
    "- You're contacting someone about a different matter\n",
    "- The old thread is very long (10+ emails)\n",
    "- It's been more than 2 weeks since the last email\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changing Subject Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "If a thread topic changes, update the subject line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Old: Subject: Meeting Tomorrow at 2 PM\n",
    "New: Subject: Meeting Follow-up - Action Items from Oct 15 Meeting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. Common Email Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Wrong Recipient\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **The Problem:**\n",
    "Sending to the wrong person, especially with sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **The Solution:**\n",
    "- Add recipients LAST (after writing the entire email)\n",
    "- Double-check all names in To/CC/BCC fields\n",
    "- Be extra careful with autocomplete suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Forgetting Attachments\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **The Problem:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Please find the report attached.\"\n",
    "[No attachment included]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **The Solution:**\n",
    "- Attach files FIRST before writing the email\n",
    "- Use email software features that detect \"attached\" in text\n",
    "- Create a mental checklist before clicking Send\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Unclear or Missing Subject Line\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Hi\"\n",
    "- \"Question\"\n",
    "- \"Help!\"\n",
    "- [Blank subject]\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Question about Database Migration Timeline\"\n",
    "- \"Help Needed: Debug Error in User Authentication Module\"\n",
    "- \"Request: Extend Project Deadline to Oct 30\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Unprofessional Email Address\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't Use:**\n",
    "- cutiepie123@email.com\n",
    "- partygirl2024@email.com\n",
    "- darklord666@email.com\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use Instead:**\n",
    "- firstname.lastname@email.com\n",
    "- f.lastname@email.com\n",
    "- firstnamelastname@email.com\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 5: Walls of Text\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Hard to Read:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I wanted to follow up on our conversation last week about the new marketing campaign we discussed at the meeting where you mentioned that we should focus on social media and also perhaps look into email marketing and I was thinking we could start with Instagram since our target audience is young professionals and then maybe expand to LinkedIn and I also think we should allocate more budget to content creation because good content is really important for engagement...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Easy to Read:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I wanted to follow up on our marketing campaign discussion from last week. Based on our meeting, I recommend we focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Social Media Platforms:\n",
    "   - Start with Instagram (primary target: young professionals)\n",
    "   - Expand to LinkedIn in Q2\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Budget Allocation:\n",
    "   - Increase content creation budget by 20%\n",
    "   - Higher quality content improves engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss the detailed plan?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 6: Emotional or Angry Tone\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Angry Email:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I can't believe you missed the deadline AGAIN! This is completely \n",
    "unacceptable and unprofessional. Your constant delays are ruining \n",
    "the entire project!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Professional Alternative:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "I noticed the deliverable was not submitted by the agreed deadline of \n",
    "October 15th. This delay impacts our project timeline significantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Could we schedule a meeting to discuss the challenges you're facing \n",
    "and how we can get back on track? I'm available tomorrow at 2 PM or \n",
    "Thursday morning.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Golden Rule**: If you feel angry, save the email as a draft and review it in 2 hours. Never send emails when emotional!"
