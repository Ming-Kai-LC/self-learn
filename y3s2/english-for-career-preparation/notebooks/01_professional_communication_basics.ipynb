    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Writing to senior executives you don't know\n",
    "- Formal complaints or legal matters\n",
    "- Official announcements\n",
    "- First contact with important clients\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I am writing to formally request approval for the proposed budget allocation. \n",
    "Please find the detailed documentation attached for your review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respectfully,\n",
    "[Your name]\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Moderately Formal (Standard professional)\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Communicating with direct supervisor\n",
    "- Writing to colleagues in other departments\n",
    "- Client communications (ongoing relationship)\n",
    "- Most business emails\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "Hi Sarah,\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for sending the report. I've reviewed it and have a few questions about \n",

    "Best regards,\n",
    "[Your name]\n",

    "#### Professional but Friendly (Warm, approachable)\n",

    "- Communicating with team members\n",
    "- Colleagues you work with regularly\n",
    "- Less formal internal communications\n",
    "- Building rapport (while still professional)\n",
