    "## 1. Why Networking Matters for Your Career\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of Professional Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Surprising statistics:**\n",
    "- **85% of jobs** are filled through networking (not job boards)\n",
    "- **70% of positions** are never publicly advertised\n",
    "- People with strong networks earn **up to 10% more** than those without\n",
    "- **4 out of 5 professionals** consider networking essential for career success\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Professional Networking?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Networking is:** Building and maintaining mutually beneficial professional relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Networking is NOT:**\n",
    "- ❌ Asking strangers for jobs\n",
    "- ❌ Only collecting business cards\n",
    "- ❌ Being fake or manipulative\n",
    "- ❌ Only reaching out when you need something\n",
    "\n",
    "**Networking IS:**\n",
    "- ✅ Building genuine relationships over time\n",
    "- ✅ Offering help and value to others\n",
    "- ✅ Staying in touch regularly\n",
    "- ✅ Creating a community of professional connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where Networking Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "| Context | Examples | Formality Level |\n",
    "|---------|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Formal Events** | Industry conferences, career fairs, professional association meetings | Very formal |\n",
    "| **Semi-Formal** | Company events, alumni gatherings, workshops | Moderately formal |\n",
    "| **Informal** | Coffee chats, LinkedIn messages, casual meetups | Professional but relaxed |\n",
    "| **Online** | LinkedIn, Twitter, professional forums, virtual events | Varies |\n",
    "| **Workplace** | Team meetings, cross-department projects, company socials | Professional-friendly |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Networking Mindset Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instead of thinking:**\n",
    "- \"I need to get something from this person\"\n",
    "- \"I'm bothering them by reaching out\"\n",
    "- \"I have nothing to offer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think:**\n",
    "- \"How can we help each other?\"\n",

    "| \"I don't know what to say\" | Most conversations follow predictable patterns | Learn and practice conversation templates (this module!) |\n",
    "| \"I'll be rejected or ignored\" | Most people are friendly and open | Start with low-stakes interactions (alumni, mutual connections) |\n",
    "| \"I'm too junior/inexperienced\" | Everyone started somewhere | Position yourself as eager to learn |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Do:**\n",
    "- ✅ Practice until it sounds natural (not memorized)\n",
    "- ✅ Adapt for different audiences (technical vs. non-technical)\n",
    "- ✅ Smile and make eye contact\n",
    "- ✅ End with a question to continue the conversation\n",
    "- ✅ Include one memorable detail\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't:**\n",
    "- ❌ Speak too fast (breathe!)\n",
    "- ❌ Use excessive jargon\n",
    "- ❌ Apologize or sound uncertain\n",
    "- ❌ Go over 60 seconds\n",
    "- ❌ Sound rehearsed or robotic"

    "```\n",

    "- **F**amily (general, not too personal)\n",
    "  - \"Do you have family in the area?\"\n",

    "   - \"That's interesting...\"\n",
    "   - \"I see...\"\n",
    "   - \"That makes sense...\"\n",
    "   - \"Tell me more about...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Verbal Cues**\n",
    "   - Nod occasionally\n",
    "   - Maintain eye contact\n",
    "   - Lean in slightly\n",
    "   - Appropriate facial expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Follow-Up Questions**\n",
    "   - \"How did you approach that challenge?\"\n",
    "   - \"What was the outcome?\"\n",
    "   - \"What did you learn from that experience?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Paraphrasing**\n",
    "   - \"So if I understand correctly, you're saying...\"\n",
    "   - \"It sounds like the main issue was...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joining Ongoing Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to join a group conversation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observe first** (listen for 30-60 seconds)\n",
    "2. **Make eye contact** with someone in the group\n",
    "3. **Position yourself** at the edge of the group (don't interrupt)\n",
    "4. **Wait for a pause**, then:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \"Sorry to interrupt - I couldn't help but overhear you discussing [topic]. \n",
    "   That's really interesting. I'm [Name], by the way.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**If they're in a private conversation** (backs turned, intense discussion):\n",
    "- Don't interrupt\n",
    "- Find a different group or individual to talk to\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ending Conversations Gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to exit:**\n",
    "- Conversation has naturally run its course\n",
    "- You want to meet more people at the event\n",
    "- The other person seems ready to move on\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to exit politely:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "• \"It's been great talking with you. I should let you mingle. \n",
    "   Let's exchange contact information.\"\n",
