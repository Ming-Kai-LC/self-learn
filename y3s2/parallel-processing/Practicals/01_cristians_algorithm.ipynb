    "### What is Cristian's Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cristian's Algorithm is a method for synchronizing time between a **time server** and **client processes** in a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        CLOCK SERVER\n",
    "            T_SERVER\n",
    "               •\n",
    "              /|\\\n",
    "    REQUEST  / | \\ RESPONSE\n",
    "            /  |  \\\n",

    "         T0    RTD   T1\n",
    "      PROCESS/CLIENT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client sends request** at time `T0`\n",
    "2. **Server receives request** and responds with server time `T_SERVER`\n",
    "3. **Client receives response** at time `T1`\n",
    "4. **Client calculates synchronized time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "T_CLIENT = T_SERVER + (T1 - T0) / 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Formula Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- `(T1 - T0)` = Round Trip Time (RTT)\n",
    "- `(T1 - T0) / 2` = Estimated one-way latency (assuming symmetric network)\n",
    "- **Synchronization error** ≤ `(T1 - T0) / 2` seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Cristian's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Best for**:\n",
    "- Low-latency networks (short RTT)\n",
    "- Single time server architecture\n",
    "- Applications where millisecond accuracy is sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Not suitable for**:\n",
