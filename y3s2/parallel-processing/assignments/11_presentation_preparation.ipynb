    "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n",
    "Good Answer:\n",
    "\"We chose [approach] because:\n",
    "1. The problem exhibits [data/task] parallelism, which is well-suited for\n",
    "   [shared memory/GPU/distributed] model\n",
    "2. [Approach] provides [specific benefit, e.g., 'fine-grained control',\n",
    "   'high throughput', 'ease of implementation']\n",
    "3. We had access to [hardware type] which supports this approach\n",
    "4. Literature review showed [approach] was effective for similar problems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad Answer:\n",
    "\"Because the assignment said we could use it\" ❌\n",
    "\"I don't know, my teammate chose it\" ❌\n",

    "\"We identified two main bottlenecks:\n",
    "1. [Specific bottleneck, e.g., 'Memory bandwidth when transferring data\n",
    "   between CPU and GPU']\n",
    "   - We addressed this by [solution, e.g., 'overlapping computation with\n",
    "     transfers using streams']\n",
    "2. [Another bottleneck, e.g., 'Serial initialization phase']\n",
    "   - This limited our maximum theoretical speedup according to Amdahl's Law\n",

    "\n",
    "We measured these using [profiling tool] and optimized [specific aspect].\"\n",

    "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n",

    "1. Direct comparison: Parallel output matches serial output exactly for\n",

    "2. Known results: Tested against [analytical solutions/benchmark datasets]\n",
    "3. Edge cases: Verified behavior with [small inputs, large inputs,\n",

    "1. I would [specific improvement, e.g., 'profile the serial code earlier\n",
    "   to identify hotspots before parallelizing']\n",
    "2. We could have [alternative approach, e.g., 'used a hybrid approach\n",
