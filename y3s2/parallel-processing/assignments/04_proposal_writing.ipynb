    "\n",
    "1.1 Background and Motivation (1 paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Context: What is the general area?]\n",
    "[Example: \"Image processing is a fundamental component of computer vision applications,\n",
    "ranging from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles. As image resolutions increase\n",
    "(4K, 8K, and beyond), processing time becomes a critical bottleneck.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Motivation: Why is this problem important?]\n",
    "[Example: \"Real-time video processing requires processing 30-60 frames per second,\n",
    "which is infeasible with serial algorithms on high-resolution images. Parallel\n",
    "computing offers a solution to meet these performance demands.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Problem Statement (1-2 paragraphs)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Specific problem: What exactly will you solve?]\n",
    "[Example: \"Current serial implementations of Gaussian blur, edge detection, and\n",
    "sharpening filters require 2-5 seconds per 4K image, making real-time processing\n",
    "impossible. This project addresses the computational inefficiency of serial image\n",
    "filtering algorithms.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Technical challenge: What makes this difficult?]\n",
    "[Example: \"Image filtering has O(n²k²) complexity where n is image dimension and k\n",
    "is kernel size. For a 3840×2160 image with a 5×5 kernel, this involves 200+ million\n",
    "operations per filter, creating a significant computational burden.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Your approach: How will you tackle it?]\n",
    "[Example: \"We propose implementing parallel image filtering using both OpenMP (CPU)\n",
    "and CUDA (GPU) to compare different parallelization strategies and identify optimal\n",
    "approaches for different image sizes.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 Research Objectives (bullet points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To implement parallel versions of common image filters (Gaussian blur, edge\n",
    "   detection, sharpening) using OpenMP and CUDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To analyze and compare performance of CPU-based (OpenMP) versus GPU-based (CUDA)\n",
    "   parallelization for various image sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To identify optimal parallelization strategies and their applicable scenarios\n",
    "   based on image dimensions and filter complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To achieve a minimum speedup of [X]x over serial implementation while maintaining\n",
    "   numerical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Make objectives SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound]\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 Scope and Limitations (1 paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope:\n",
    "[What WILL you do?]\n",
    "[Example: \"This project focuses on three common convolution-based filters: Gaussian\n",
    "blur, edge detection (Sobel), and sharpening. We will implement serial, OpenMP, and\n",
    "CUDA versions, testing on image sizes from 512×512 to 4096×4096 pixels.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "[What WON'T you do?]\n",
    "[Example: \"This project does not cover real-time video streaming, color space\n",
    "conversions beyond RGB, or adaptive filter selection. We focus solely on grayscale\n",
    "images to isolate parallelization effects. Distributed implementations (MPI) are\n",
    "beyond the scope of this project.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5 Organization of This Proposal (1 paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Brief roadmap of the document]\n",
    "[Example: \"The remainder of this proposal is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews\n",
    "existing parallel image processing solutions; Section 3 describes our proposed\n",
    "methodology including algorithm design and platform selection; Section 4 outlines\n",
