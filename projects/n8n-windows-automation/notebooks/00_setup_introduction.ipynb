    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand what n8n is and why it's useful for automation\n",
    "2. Identify which installation method is right for your Windows setup\n",

    "## What is n8n?\n",
    "\n",
    "n8n (pronounced \"n-eight-n\") is a powerful **workflow automation tool** that lets you connect different apps and services together without writing complex code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "- **IFTTT** (If This Then That) - but more powerful and self-hosted\n",
    "- **Zapier** - but you own your data and it's free\n",
    "- **Microsoft Power Automate** - but open-source and more flexible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you can automate with n8n:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Email Management**: Auto-save Gmail attachments to Google Drive\n",
    "2. **Social Media**: Post the same content to Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook simultaneously\n",
    "3. **Data Sync**: Keep your CRM updated when new leads come from your website\n",
    "4. **Notifications**: Get Telegram messages when your website goes down\n",
    "5. **Report Generation**: Create weekly reports from your business data automatically"

    "- ✅ Best battery life on laptops\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to update\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- ❌ Not isolated from other apps\n",
    "- ❌ Harder to manage multiple versions\n",
    "- ❌ Not production-ready for critical workflows\n",

    "- ❌ High RAM overhead (2-4 GB)\n",
    "- ❌ Worse battery life\n",
    "- ❌ More complex troubleshooting\n",
