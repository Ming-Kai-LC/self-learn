## What to Do With Results

### If Results Show Progress ✅

1. **Celebrate**: You're improving!
2. **Analyze**: Which skill improved most? Why?
3. **Continue**: Current approach is working
4. **Adjust**: Can you replicate success in weaker skills?

### If Results Show No Progress ⏸️

**Don't panic**. Plateaus are normal. Ask yourself:

1. **Consistency**: Did I practice 12+ hours/week?
2. **Active practice**: Or just passive consumption?
3. **AI interaction**: Daily speaking/writing with AI?
4. **Challenge level**: Am I working at edge of ability?
5. **Tracking**: Did I log errors and review them?

**Plateau breakers**:
- Increase study hours 25%
- Switch focus to weakest skill
- Increase difficulty level
- More AI conversation practice
- Add immersion (change phone to English)

### If One Skill Lags Behind 📉

**Common scenario**: Listening/Reading at B2, but Speaking/Writing at B1

**Solution**:
- Dedicate 60% of time to lagging skill
- Daily practice mandatory for weak skill
- Reduce time on strong skills temporarily
- Track weak skill progress weekly
