    "\n",
    "### The Speaking Problem at B2\n",
    "\n",
    "Most learners at B2 level can:\n",
    "- ✅ Understand complex texts\n",
    "- ✅ Write professional emails\n",
    "- ✅ Comprehend podcasts and videos\n",
    "\n",
    "But struggle to:\n",
    "- ❌ Speak fluently in real-time\n",
    "- ❌ Use correct grammar while speaking (vs. writing)\n",
    "- ❌ Maintain conversations without long pauses\n",
    "- ❌ Pronounce words clearly under pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Speaking requires **simultaneous**:\n",
    "1. Thinking of ideas\n",
    "2. Choosing vocabulary\n",
    "3. Applying grammar rules\n",
    "4. Pronouncing clearly\n",
    "5. Maintaining natural speed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Gliglish Solves This\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research shows**: 75%+ improvement in speaking scores after 8 weeks of daily Gliglish practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gliglish provides**:\n",
    "- ✅ **Real-time grammar corrections** (immediate feedback)\n",
    "- ✅ **Pronunciation analysis** (shows problem sounds)\n",
    "- ✅ **Role-play scenarios** (workplace, travel, social)\n",
    "- ✅ **No judgment** (practice mistakes safely)\n",
    "- ✅ **Conversation history** (review and learn)\n",
    "- ✅ **10 minutes daily free** (perfect for busy schedules)\n",
    "\n",
    "### B2 Speaking Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve B2 speaking, you need to:\n",
    "- Speak for 15-20 minutes on familiar topics without preparation\n",
    "- Use a range of vocabulary appropriately\n",
    "- Make grammatical errors that don't impede understanding\n",
    "- Pronounce clearly enough to be understood by native speakers\n",

    "## Part 2: Setting Up Gliglish for B2 Success\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Account Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visit**: https://gliglish.com/\n",
    "2. **Sign up**: Email or Google account\n",
    "3. **Select**:\n",
    "   - Target language: **English**\n",
    "   - Your level: **Intermediate** (B1) or **Upper-Intermediate** (B2)\n",
    "   - Goal: **Professional fluency** or **General conversation**\n",
    "4. **Allow**: Microphone access when prompted\n",
    "5. **Choose accent** (optional): American, British, Australian\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Configure for B2 Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversation mode settings**:\n",
    "- **Speed**: Normal (not slow)\n",
    "- **Correction style**: Immediate (shows errors right away)\n",
    "- **Topic difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced\n",
    "- **Scenario type**: Workplace, presentations, negotiations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Test Your Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before starting**:\n",
    "1. Use headphones with microphone (better quality than built-in)\n",
    "2. Find quiet space (minimal background noise)\n",
    "3. Test: Say a sentence and verify Gliglish transcribes correctly\n",
    "4. Adjust volume and mic distance as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Set Daily Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency is key**:\n",
    "- Same time daily (e.g., 7:00 AM before work, 8:00 PM after dinner)\n",
    "- Calendar notification: \"Gliglish 10-min practice\"\n",
    "- Treat it like a meeting (non-negotiable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip**: Pair with another habit:\n",
    "- \"After morning coffee → Gliglish\"\n",
    "- \"Before checking email → Gliglish\"\n",
    "- \"During lunch break → Gliglish\""

    "### The 10-Minute Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Free tier = 10 minutes daily. Here's how to make every second count:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minutes 1-2: Warm-Up (Quick Topic)\n",
    "- Start with easy topic (weather, weekend, hobbies)\n",
    "- Get comfortable hearing your voice\n",
    "- Build confidence before challenging topics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example warm-up questions**:\n",
    "- \"What did you do last weekend?\"\n",
    "- \"Tell me about your job\"\n",
    "- \"What are your plans for today?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minutes 3-7: Core Practice (Challenging Topic)\n",
    "- Switch to B2 workplace scenario\n",
    "- Focus on one skill (e.g., explaining problems, giving updates)\n",
    "- Push yourself to use new vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**B2 scenarios**:\n",
    "- **Project update**: Explain current status, challenges, next steps\n",
    "- **Problem-solving**: Describe issue, propose solutions\n",
    "- **Client meeting**: Present ideas, handle objections\n",
    "- **Job interview**: Answer behavioral questions\n",
    "- **Presentation**: Explain complex topic clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minutes 8-10: Review and Note-Taking\n",
    "- Review corrections shown during conversation\n",
    "- Screenshot/note recurring errors\n",
    "- Plan tomorrow's focus based on today's mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daily Rotation Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't practice same topic daily**. Rotate through:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day | Focus Skill | Scenario Example |\n",
    "|-----|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Mon** | Explaining problems | \"My project is delayed because...\" |\n",

    "| **Thu** | Describing processes | \"First we... then... finally...\" |\n",
    "| **Fri** | Negotiating | \"Would it be possible to...?\" |\n",

    "## Part 4: Understanding Gliglish Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Corrections You'll See\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Grammar Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- ❌ You said: \"I have work here for 3 years\"\n",
    "- ✅ Correction: \"I have **worked** here for 3 years\"\n",
    "- 📝 Rule: Present perfect needs past participle\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Word Choice Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- ❌ You said: \"I want to say my opinion\"\n",
    "- ✅ Correction: \"I'd like to **share** my opinion\"\n",
    "- 📝 Rule: \"Share opinion\" is more natural than \"say opinion\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Pronunciation Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- ❌ You said: /pro-JECT/ (noun)\n",
    "- ✅ Correction: /PRO-ject/ (noun) vs. /pro-JECT/ (verb)\n",
    "- 📝 Rule: Noun stress on first syllable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Fluency Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- ❌ \"Um... I think... well... maybe we should...\"\n",
    "- ✅ \"I think we should...\"\n",
    "- 📝 Rule: Reduce fillers for professional speech\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use Corrections Effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "**During conversation**:\n",
    "1. Note the correction (Gliglish shows it in real-time)\n",
    "2. Repeat the corrected version aloud immediately\n",
    "3. Continue conversation using correct form\n",
    "\n",
    "**After conversation**:\n",
    "1. Review conversation history in Gliglish\n",
    "2. Identify patterns (same error multiple times?)\n",
    "3. Write down top 3 errors in error log\n",
    "4. Practice corrected versions with AI tutor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip**: If same error appears 3+ times, create a ChatGPT drill:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I keep making this error: [your error]. \n",
    "Please create 10 practice sentences for me to say correctly.\n",
