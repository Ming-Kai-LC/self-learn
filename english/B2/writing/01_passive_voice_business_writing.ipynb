    "## Part 1: Why Passive Voice Matters for B2\n",
    "\n",
    "Passive voice is **essential** for professional English because:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Business Writing Uses It Heavily\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reports**:\n",
    "- ✅ \"The proposal was approved by the board\" (passive—formal)\n",
    "- ❌ \"The board approved the proposal\" (active—less formal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal emails**:\n",
    "- ✅ \"The deadline has been extended to Friday\"\n",
    "- ❌ \"We extended the deadline to Friday\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process descriptions**:\n",
    "- ✅ \"The data is collected weekly and analyzed monthly\"\n",
    "- ❌ \"We collect the data weekly and analyze it monthly\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Changes Focus and Tone\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus on action, not actor**:\n",
    "- Active: \"Someone stole my laptop\" (focus: thief)\n",
    "- Passive: \"My laptop was stolen\" (focus: laptop)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diplomatic/softer tone**:\n",
    "- Active: \"You made a mistake\" (direct, can sound accusatory)\n",
    "- Passive: \"A mistake was made\" (softer, less confrontational)\n",

    "### 3. Required for B2 Certification\n",

    "Cambridge B2 First and IELTS 6.0-7.0 expect accurate passive voice use in:\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Understood why passive voice is essential for B2 professional English\n",
    "2. ✅ Learned passive voice formation across all major tenses\n",
    "3. ✅ Practiced forming passive sentences with AI feedback\n",
    "4. ✅ Identified when to use passive vs. active voice\n",
    "5. ✅ Applied passive voice in real business contexts\n",
    "6. ✅ Learned to spot and correct common errors\n",
    "7. ✅ Wrote a complete professional report using passive appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passive voice is a B2 essential because**:\n",
    "- Required for formal business writing\n",
    "- Shifts focus from actor to action\n",
    "- Softens tone diplomatically\n",
    "- Standard in reports, procedures, announcements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use passive when**:\n",
    "- Action > Actor in importance\n",
    "- Actor is unknown or obvious\n",
    "- Writing formally\n",
    "- Being diplomatic\n",
    "- Describing processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid passive when**:\n",
    "- Actor is important\n",
    "- Writing casually for impact\n",
    "- Sentence becomes awkward\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balance is key**: Mix 30-40% passive with 60-70% active for natural professional writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily practice**: Review work emails—identify passive voice usage\n",
    "2. **AI conversations**: Request feedback on passive voice in your writing\n",
    "3. **Error log**: Track passive voice mistakes you make\n",
    "4. **Next module**: Continue to `02_reported_speech.ipynb` for another B2 essential\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Practice Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Week 1**: Complete all AI exercises in this notebook\n",
    "- **Week 2**: Write 5 professional emails using passive appropriately\n",
    "- **Week 3**: Review and convert active sentences to passive in real documents\n",
    "- **Week 4**: Write project report/proposal with balanced active/passive use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mastery indicator**: You instinctively know when passive sounds more professional than active! 🎯"
