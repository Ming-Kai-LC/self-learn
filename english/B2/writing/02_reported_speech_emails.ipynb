    "## Part 1: Why Reported Speech Matters for B2 Professional Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Business Need\n",
    "\n",
    "In professional contexts, you constantly need to report:\n",
    "- What clients said in meetings\n",
    "- What colleagues requested via email\n",
    "- What managers asked in discussions\n",
    "- What competitors announced\n",
    "- What stakeholders decided\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenarios**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**After a client meeting**:\n",
    "- ❌ Direct: The client said: \"We need this by Friday.\"\n",
    "- ✅ Reported: The client **said they needed** it by Friday.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forwarding a request**:\n",
    "- ❌ Direct: Sarah asked: \"Can you send the report?\"\n",
    "- ✅ Reported: Sarah **asked if I could send** the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meeting minutes**:\n",
    "- ❌ Direct: The manager said: \"I want everyone to attend.\"\n",
    "- ✅ Reported: The manager **said he wanted** everyone to attend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Essential for B2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cambridge B2 First** and **IELTS 6.5-7.0** require:\n",
    "- Accurate transformation of direct → reported speech\n",
    "- Appropriate use in formal writing\n",
    "- Correct tense backshift\n",
    "- Professional email communication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reported speech makes you sound**:\n",
    "- ✅ Professional (not quoting like a conversation)\n",
    "- ✅ Formal (appropriate for business writing)\n",
    "- ✅ Concise (integrates information smoothly)\n",
    "- ✅ Competent (B2+ level skill)"

    "## Part 2: Reported Speech Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Transformation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 1: Tense Backshift\n",
    "\n",
    "When the reporting verb is in the past (said, told, asked), shift tenses back:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Present Simple: \"I **work** here\" | Past Simple: He said he **worked** there |\n",
    "| Present Continuous: \"I'm **working**\" | Past Continuous: She said she **was working** |\n",
    "| Past Simple: \"I **worked**\" | Past Perfect: He said he **had worked** |\n",
    "| Present Perfect: \"I **have worked**\" | Past Perfect: She said she **had worked** |\n",
    "| Will: \"I **will finish**\" | Would: He said he **would finish** |\n",
    "| Can: \"I **can help**\" | Could: She said she **could help** |\n",
    "| Must: \"I **must go**\" | Had to: He said he **had to go** |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 2: Pronoun Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct**: \"**I** will send **you** the report.\"\n",
    "- John said to me ↓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reported**: John said **he** would send **me** the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 3: Time/Place Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Direct | Reported |\n",
    "|--------|----------|\n",
    "| today | that day |\n",
    "| tomorrow | the next day / the following day |\n",
    "| yesterday | the day before / the previous day |\n",
    "| next week | the following week |\n",
    "| last week | the previous week |\n",
    "| here | there |\n",
    "| this | that |\n",
    "| these | those |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Direct: \"I'll finish this **today**.\"\n",
    "- Reported: She said she would finish that **that day**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Backshift\n",
    "\n",
    "**No backshift if**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The statement is still true**:\n",
    "   - Direct: \"The office **is** in London.\"\n",
    "   - Reported: He said the office **is** in London. (still true)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **General truths**:\n",
    "   - Direct: \"Water **boils** at 100°C.\"\n",
    "   - Reported: She said water **boils** at 100°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recent past with present reporting**:\n",
    "   - Direct: \"I **finished** the report.\" (just now)\n",
    "   - Reported: John says he **has finished** the report."

    "\n",
    "**Core Transformation Rules**:\n",
    "- **Tense backshift**: Present → Past, Will → Would, Can → Could\n",
    "- **Pronoun changes**: Based on perspective\n",
    "- **Time/place**: today → that day, here → there\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reporting Structures**:\n",
    "- **Statements**: said/told/mentioned + (that) + clause\n",
    "- **Yes/No questions**: asked + if/whether + statement order\n",
    "- **Wh- questions**: asked + wh-word + statement order\n",
    "- **Requests**: asked + person + to + infinitive\n",
    "- **Commands**: told + person + to + infinitive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reporting Verb Variety**:\n",
    "- Neutral: said, told, mentioned, reported\n",
    "- Strong: insisted, emphasized, announced\n",

    "- ❌ \"Say\" + person (use \"tell\" instead)\n",
    "- ❌ \"That\" after asked (use if/whether)\n",
    "- ❌ Missing pronoun changes\n",
    "\n",
