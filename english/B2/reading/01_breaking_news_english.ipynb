    "### Technique 1: Predicting Content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before reading**, look at:\n",
    "- Title\n",
    "- Subtitle\n",
    "- First paragraph\n",
    "- Any images\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask yourself**:\n",
    "- What will this article be about?\n",
    "- What do I already know about this topic?\n",
    "- What vocabulary might appear?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Title: \"Electric Cars Sales Reach Record High\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicted vocabulary**:\n",
    "- electric vehicles, emissions, sustainable\n",
    "- battery, charging stations\n",
    "- environmentally friendly, carbon footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technique 2: SQ3R Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**S**urvey → **Q**uestion → **R**ead → **R**ecite → **R**eview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Survey**: Skim the article (2 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Turn headings into questions\n",
    "- Heading: \"Rising Sales\"\n",
    "- Question: \"Why are sales rising?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read**: Read to answer your questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recite**: Summarize in your own words (no looking!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review**: Check your summary against article\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technique 3: Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "**While reading, mark**:\n",
    "- ⭐ Main ideas\n",
    "- 📝 Important details\n",
    "- ❓ Questions or confusion\n",
    "- 💡 Interesting points\n",
    "- 📚 New vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital**: Use highlighting in PDF reader  \n",
    "**Physical**: Use different colored pens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technique 4: Summarizing Paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "After each paragraph, write one sentence summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- **Para 1**: Electric car sales increased 40% in 2023\n",

    "\"The company uses **sustainable** practices, meaning they operate in ways that don't harm the environment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clue**: \"meaning\" signals definition\n",
    "**Guess**: sustainable = environmentally friendly\n",

    "#### Strategy 2: Example Clues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\"Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are becoming more popular.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clue**: examples given (solar, wind, hydroelectric)\n",
    "**Guess**: renewable = natural, doesn't run out\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy 3: Contrast Clues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\"Unlike traditional cars that produce emissions, electric vehicles are environmentally friendly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clue**: \"unlike\" signals contrast\n",
    "**Guess**: emissions = pollution/harmful gases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy 4: General Context\n",

    "**Example**:\n",
    "\"The government implemented new policies to **mitigate** climate change. These measures include carbon taxes and renewable energy incentives.\"\n",

    "### Which Words to Actually Look Up\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look up words that are**:\n",
    "1. **Repeated** multiple times in article\n",
    "2. **Essential** to main idea\n",
    "3. **Useful** for other contexts\n",

    "**Native speaker**: 250-300 words/min\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why you're slow**:\n",
    "1. **Subvocalization** (saying words in your head)\n",
    "2. **Regression** (re-reading sentences)\n",
    "3. **Word-by-word reading** (not reading in chunks)\n",
    "4. **Dictionary dependence** (looking up too many words)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed Building Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technique 1: Timed Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**:\n",
    "1. Choose Breaking News English article\n",
    "2. Note word count (e.g., 650 words)\n",
    "3. Set timer\n",
    "4. Read without stopping\n",
    "5. Calculate: words ÷ minutes = WPM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Article: 650 words\n",
    "- Time: 8 minutes\n",
    "- Speed: 650 ÷ 8 = 81 WPM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weekly goal**: Increase by 10-20 WPM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technique 2: Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't read**: word → by → word → like → this\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do read**: in phrases / like this / using natural chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The government / announced new policies / to combat climate change /\n",
    "including carbon taxes / and renewable energy incentives.\n",

    "\n",

    "- Move smoothly left to right\n",
    "- Never move backward\n",
