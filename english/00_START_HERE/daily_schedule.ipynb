    "\n",
    "The 12-hour framework is flexible. Here's how to adapt it to your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Can't do mornings?**\n",
    "- Move morning routine to evening commute\n",
    "- Or split into two 10-minute blocks during the day\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Irregular work schedule?**\n",
    "- Keep total 12 hours/week but distribute differently\n",
    "- Example: 4 days × 1.5 hours + 2 days × 3 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Weekend work commitments?**\n",
    "- Do intensive sessions on days off\n",
    "- Or extend weekday evenings to 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Less than 12 hours available?**\n",
    "- Still progress, just slower (double timeline estimates)\n",
    "- Prioritize: AI conversations (15 min) + one other skill daily\n",
    "- Maintain consistency over intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Negotiables\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever your schedule, keep these:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Daily AI conversation** (even if just 10 minutes)  \n",
    "✅ **Weekend longer sessions** (at least one 2-hour block)  \n",
    "✅ **All four skills weekly** (speaking, listening, reading, writing)  \n",
    "✅ **Consistency** (better 45 min/day than 5 hours once/week)"

    "\n",
    "### \"I'm too tired in the evenings\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- Do AI conversation first (most engaging when tired)\n",
    "- Save writing practice for weekends\n",
    "- Listen to podcasts (passive, less draining)\n",
    "- 15 minutes is better than 0 minutes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"I miss days and feel guilty\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- One missed day ≠ failure\n",
    "- Just resume next day, don't try to \"catch up\"\n",
    "- Aim for 5-6 days/week, not perfection\n",
    "- Track practice to see you're doing better than you think\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"I can't focus for full sessions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- Break into smaller chunks (5-10 min)\n",
    "- Use Pomodoro: 25 min work, 5 min break\n",
    "- Vary activities within session\n",
    "- Make it fun (topics you care about)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"My schedule is unpredictable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- Set weekly goal (12 hours), not daily requirements\n",
    "- Keep \"emergency\" activities ready (podcast queue, vocabulary app)\n",
    "- Use waiting time productively (commutes, queues)\n",
    "- Weekend sessions can compensate for busy weekdays\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"I don't see progress\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- Progress is invisible week-to-week, visible month-to-month\n",
    "- Take monthly assessments for objective data\n",
    "- Keep error log to see which mistakes disappeared\n",
    "- Revisit old content to notice how much easier it is now"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Learned the research-backed 12-hour weekly schedule\n",
    "2. ✅ Understood daily routines (morning, lunch, evening)\n",
    "3. ✅ Explored weekend intensive sessions\n",
    "4. ✅ Created a practice tracking system\n",
    "5. ✅ Learned to customize the schedule for your life\n",
    "6. ✅ Identified solutions to common obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Consistency beats intensity. The magic is in the daily habit, not the perfect schedule. Start with what you can manage, track it, and build from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Action Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Today**: Choose your time blocks (morning/lunch/evening/weekend)\n",
    "2. **Tomorrow**: Start with just morning + evening (35 min total)\n",
    "3. **This week**: Add lunch podcast (reach 50 min/day weekdays)\n",
    "4. **This weekend**: Try your first intensive session\n",
    "5. **Ongoing**: Log daily, review weekly, adjust as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continue to**: `resources/tools_guide.md`  \n",
    "Set up all the AI tools (Gliglish, Grammarly, WordUp, etc.) you'll use in this schedule.\n",
