# Quick Start Guide - 30 Minutes to Your First Lesson

**Get started with the English Learning curriculum in just 30 minutes!**

---

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Minutes 1-5**: Technical setup
- **Minutes 6-15**: Find your level
- **Minutes 16-25**: Set up one AI tool
- **Minutes 26-30**: Start your first notebook

---

## Step 1: Technical Setup (5 minutes)

### Install Python & Jupyter

**Already have Python?** Skip to checking Jupyter.

**macOS/Linux**:
```bash
# Check if Python installed
python3 --version

# If not installed, download from python.org
# Then install Jupyter
pip3 install jupyter notebook pandas

# Test it
jupyter notebook
```

**Windows**:
```bash
# Check if Python installed
python --version

# If not installed, download from python.org
# Then install Jupyter
pip install jupyter notebook pandas

# Test it
jupyter notebook
```

**✅ Checkpoint**: Jupyter should open in your browser at `localhost:8888`

---

## Step 2: Find Your Level (10 minutes)

### Quick Self-Assessment

**Choose the statement that best describes you**:

**A1 - Absolute Beginner**
- "I know almost no English" or "I can say 'hello' and count to 10"
- **Start here**: `A1/writing/01_the_alphabet_and_your_name.ipynb`

**A2 - Elementary**
- "I can introduce myself and talk about family/hobbies simply"
- "I can order food and ask for directions"
- **Start here**: `A2/writing/01_personal_messages_and_notes.ipynb`

**B1 - Intermediate**
- "I can discuss work, travel plans, and personal experiences"
- "I can write simple emails and understand TV shows (with effort)"
- **Start here**: `B1/writing/01_simple_emails.ipynb`

**B2 - Upper-Intermediate**
- "I can give presentations at work and write professional emails"
- "I understand news and can discuss complex topics"
- **Start here**: `B2/writing/01_passive_voice_business_writing.ipynb`

**C1 - Advanced**
- "I can express myself fluently in professional/academic settings"
- "I rarely make grammar mistakes"
- **Start here**: `C1/writing/01_advanced_academic_writing.ipynb`

**C2 - Near-Native**
- "I want to achieve native-level proficiency"
- "I can handle any situation but want to refine skills"
- **Start here**: `C2/writing/01_mastery_of_style_and_register.ipynb`

### Still Not Sure?

**Take the 5-minute test**:
1. Open `00_START_HERE/skill_assessment.ipynb`
2. Answer the self-assessment questions
3. Note your level
4. Start there!

**✅ Checkpoint**: You now know which level folder to use (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, or C2)

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your First AI Tool (10 minutes)

**Choose ONE to start** (you can add more later):

### Option A: ChatGPT (Best for Writing & General Practice)

1. Go to `chat.openai.com`
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Use Google/email to create account
4. **Test it**:

Type this prompt:
```
I'm learning English at [YOUR LEVEL] level. Please have a simple conversation with me about my hobbies. Correct any mistakes I make.
```

**✅ You're ready!** ChatGPT will help with writing and conversation practice.

### Option B: Gliglish (Best for Speaking Practice)

1. Download "Gliglish" app (iOS/Android)
2. Create free account
3. Select your level (A1-C2)
4. Start a conversation!

**✅ You're ready!** Practice speaking 10-15 min/day.

### Option C: Just Start Without AI (For Now)

**That's okay!** You can:
- Complete notebooks without AI tools
- Add tools later when you're ready
- Focus on learning the content first

**✅ You can skip this step** and come back to `resources/tools_guide.md` later.

## Step 4: Start Your First Notebook! (5 minutes)

### Open Your First Notebook

**In Jupyter**:
1. Navigate to your level folder (e.g., `B2/`)

```

### How to Use It

1. **Read the objectives** - Know what you're aiming for
2. **Work through each section** - Read, run code cells, take notes
3. **Try the AI practice** - Copy prompts to ChatGPT/Gliglish
4. **Complete exercises** - Do all practice tasks
5. **Review summary** - Check you met objectives

### Run a Code Cell

## 🎉 You're Done! Next Steps...

### Your First Week Plan

**Day 1** (today): Complete first writing notebook (45 min)
**Day 2**: Writing notebook 02 (45 min)
**Day 3**: Speaking practice with AI (30 min)
**Day 4**: Listening notebook 01 (45 min)
**Day 5**: Reading notebook 01 (45 min)
**Day 6**: Review + mixed practice (60 min)
**Day 7**: Rest or light practice (optional)

**Total Week 1**: 4-5 hours of focused study

### Tips for Success

**1. Study Same Time Daily**
- Morning before work?
- Evening after dinner?
- Pick a time and stick to it!

**2. Start Small**
- 30 min/day is better than 0 min/day
- Build the habit first
- Increase time gradually

**3. Use Idle Time**
- Listen to English podcasts while commuting
- Read English news during breaks
- Practice speaking while walking

**4. Track Your Progress**
- Keep a simple log (date, notebook, time spent)
- Celebrate completing each notebook
- Review weekly

### When You Get Stuck

**Content too easy?**
→ Jump up one level (e.g., B1 → B2)

**Content too hard?**
→ Go down one level (e.g., B2 → B1)

**Don't understand something?**
→ Ask ChatGPT to explain in simpler terms

**Lost motivation?**
→ Remember why you started. Set a small goal for today.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to pay for anything?**
A: No! All notebooks are free. AI tools have free tiers (ChatGPT, Gliglish, etc.). Paid options exist but aren't required.

**Q: How long will it take to complete my level?**
A: Depends on your level and study time:
- A1 (40 notebooks): 2-4 months at 10hr/week
- B2 (80 notebooks): 5-8 months at 10hr/week
- C1 (60 notebooks): 6-10 months at 10hr/week

**Q: Can I skip notebooks?**
A: Not recommended. They build on each other. Complete in order for best results.

**Q: What if I only have 30 min/day?**
A: Perfect! That's enough for one notebook every 1-2 days. You'll make steady progress.

**Q: Do I need all 4 skills?**
A: For balanced English, yes. But if you need to focus (e.g., speaking for work), prioritize that skill first.
