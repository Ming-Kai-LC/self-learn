### BATCH 1: Perfect Tenses Mastery (Modules 1-5)
**Status:** SPECIFIED & READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
**Theme:** Temporal sophistication - complex time relationships
**Total Exercises:** ~460
**Estimated Time:** 28-32 hours

| Module | Title | Key Grammar | Exercises | Difficulty |
|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Present Perfect vs Past Simple | Time reference distinction | 100 | ★★★★★ |
| 2 | Present Perfect Time Markers | Already, yet, just, ever, never | 90 | ★★★☆☆ |

**Status:** PLANNED
**Theme:** Moving beyond reality - hypothetical and unreal situations
**Total Exercises:** ~455
**Estimated Time:** 28-32 hours

| 8 | Mixed Conditionals | Combining time frames | 90 | ★★★★★ |
| 9 | Conditional Alternatives | Unless, provided that, as long as, in case | 85 | ★★★☆☆ |
| 10 | Wish and If Only | Regrets and wishes | 90 | ★★★★☆ |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I skip modules if I already know some B1 grammar?**
A: Take the assessment quiz first. If you score 90%+, you may skip. However, Module 1 (Present Perfect vs Past Simple) should NOT be skipped - it's foundational even if familiar.

**Q: How long should I spend on each module?**
A: Minimum = estimated hours. Maximum = double the estimate. Don't rush Module 1 (6-7 hours), Module 6-7 (6-7 hours each), or Module 25 (7-8 hours).

**Q: Should I complete all of one batch before moving to the next?**
A: Yes. Batches are thematically organized. Complete all 5 modules in a batch before advancing.

**Q: What if I fail a module assessment?**
A: Review the module, especially areas you got wrong. Retake after 24 hours minimum. If you fail twice, consider getting tutor support.

**Q: Do I need to do all communicative practice tasks?**
A: Phase 4 is critical for B1. Do at least 60% of communicative tasks. Find partners on language exchange platforms.

**Q: Can I use this for exam preparation?**
A: Yes. This curriculum covers all B1 grammar required for Cambridge PET, IELTS 4.5-5.5, TOEFL iBT 42-71. Supplement with exam-specific practice tests.

**Q: What's the difference between B1 and A2?**
A: A2 = basic user (survival English). B1 = independent user (can handle most daily situations, express opinions, tell stories with complex timing). The jump is significant.
