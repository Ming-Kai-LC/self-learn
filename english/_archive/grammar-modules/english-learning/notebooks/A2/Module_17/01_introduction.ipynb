    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Form superlatives: the + adjective + -est, the most + adjective\n",
    "- Apply the same spelling rules as comparatives\n",
    "- Use superlatives with 'in' (the tallest in the class) and 'of' (the best of all)\n",
    "- Master irregular superlatives: the best, the worst, the farthest\n",
    "- Combine with 'one of the' for emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Level:** A2\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours\n",
    "**Comparison Focus:** superlative adjectives\n",

    "- the + adjective + -est\n",

    "### Common Errors to Avoid:\n",
    "- ❌ more better → ✅ better\n",
    "- ❌ more taller → ✅ taller\n",
    "- ❌ She is taller her brother → ✅ She is taller than her brother"
