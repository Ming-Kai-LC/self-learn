    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Form comparatives correctly: -er, more + adjective, irregular forms\n",
    "- Apply spelling rules when adding -er (double consonants, -y to -i)\n",
    "- Use 'than' correctly in comparative sentences\n",
    "- Distinguish between short adjective + -er and long adjective + more\n",
    "- Use irregular comparatives: better, worse, farther\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Level:** A2\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours\n",
    "**Comparison Focus:** comparative adjectives\n",

    "## Important Formation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- adjective + -er + than\n",
    "- more + adjective + than\n",

    "### Common Errors to Avoid:\n",
    "- ❌ more better → ✅ better\n",
    "- ❌ more taller → ✅ taller\n",
    "- ❌ She is taller her brother → ✅ She is taller than her brother"
