    "## Module Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Master essential connectors to show cause-result and contrast relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use 'because' and 'so' to connect cause and result\n",
    "2. Understand the difference between 'because' (reason) and 'so' (result)\n",
    "3. Use 'but' to express contrast between ideas\n",
    "4. Use 'although' for concession (despite contrast)\n",
    "5. Apply correct punctuation with connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This module follows the proven 4-phase learning approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1: Introduction** (14 sections)\n",
    "   - Detailed grammar explanations with examples\n",
    "   - Formation rules and usage guidelines\n",
    "   - Common errors to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase 2: Controlled Practice** (84 exercises)\n",
    "   - Structured exercises with immediate feedback\n",
    "   - Progressive difficulty\n",
    "   - Integration with previous grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Phase 3: Meaningful Practice** (10 activities)\n",
    "   - Personalized content creation\n",
    "   - Real-world application\n",
    "   - Your life, your examples\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Phase 4: Communicative Practice** (8 tasks)\n",
    "   - Authentic communication scenarios\n",
    "   - Free production\n",
    "   - Fluency development\n",
