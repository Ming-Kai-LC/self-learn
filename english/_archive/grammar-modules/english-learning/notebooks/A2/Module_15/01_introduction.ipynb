    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Form sentences with would like + noun and would like to + verb\n",
    "- Distinguish between would like (polite) and want (direct)\n",
    "- Make polite offers and invitations using would like\n",
    "- Form questions: Would you like...? / What would you like?\n",
    "- Use contractions: I'd like, you'd like, he'd like\n",

    "- No 'to' before the modal (NOT to should)\n",
    "- Questions: Modal + subject + base verb\n",
    "- Negatives: Modal + not + base verb"
