    "# Module 13: Don't Have To vs Mustn't - No Obligation vs Prohibition - Phase 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand don't have to = not necessary (no obligation)\n",
    "- Understand mustn't = prohibited (not allowed)\n",
    "- Recognize the critical meaning difference between the two\n",
    "- Use the correct form based on context (rules vs freedom)\n",
    "- Form sentences expressing lack of obligation vs prohibition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Level:** A2\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours\n",
    "**Modal Focus:** don't have to/mustn't\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Modal Verb Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "All modal verbs share these characteristics:\n",
    "- No -s in third person (he should, NOT he shoulds)\n",
    "- Followed by base verb (should go, NOT should to go)\n",
    "- No 'to' before the modal (NOT to should)\n",
    "- Questions: Modal + subject + base verb\n",
    "- Negatives: Modal + not + base verb"
