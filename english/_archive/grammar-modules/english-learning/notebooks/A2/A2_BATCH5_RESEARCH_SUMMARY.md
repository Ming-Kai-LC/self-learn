# A2 Batch 5 Research Summary and Topic Selection Rationale

**Research Date:** 2025-11-15
**Objective:** Determine optimal 5 topics for A2 Batch 5 (final A2 batch)
**Methodology:** CEFR requirements analysis, gap analysis of existing curriculum, web research, reference to Cambridge English Profile

---

## Research Question

What are the optimal 5 topics for A2 Batch 5 (Modules 21-25) that will:
1. Complete all essential A2 grammar structures
2. Fill gaps in the existing curriculum (Batches 1-4)
3. Prepare students for B1 level transition
4. Focus on practical communication skills

---

## Research Findings

### 1. CEFR A2 Official Requirements

**Source:** CEFR Grammar Levels (examenglish.com), Cambridge English Profile, Tracktest English

**Explicit A2 Grammar Requirements:**
- ✓ Adjectives – comparative and superlative (COVERED in Batch 4)
- ✓ Adverbial phrases – time, place, frequency (COVERED in Batches 2, 4)
- ✓ Articles with countable/uncountable (COVERED in A1)
- **✗ Conditionals – zero and 1st (NOT YET COVERED)**
- ✓ Future time – will and going to (COVERED in Batch 2)
- ✓ Gerunds and infinitives (COVERED: like, want, would like in Batches 1, 3)
- ✓ Modal verbs – can/could, have to, should (COVERED in Batch 3)
- ✓ Past continuous and past simple (COVERED in Batch 1)
- ✓ Present continuous for future (COVERED in Batch 2)
- ✓ Present perfect introduction (COVERED in Batch 1)
- ✓ Common phrasal verbs (COVERED in A1/A2 contextually)
- **✗ Simple connectors and linking words (ONLY "because" briefly covered)**
- **✗ Wh-questions in past tense (SCATTERED, not comprehensive)**
- **✗ Relative pronouns for definitions (NOT YET COVERED)**

**Key Finding:** 4 major A2 requirements not adequately covered in Batches 1-4.

### 2. Gap Analysis of Existing Curriculum

**Batches 1-4 Coverage (Modules 1-20):**

**Batch 1 (1-5): Past Tense Mastery**
- Past continuous formation and usage ✓
- Past continuous vs past simple ✓
- Interrupted actions ✓
- Present perfect with ever/never ✓

**Batch 2 (6-10): Future & Time**
- Going to vs will ✓
- Present continuous for future ✓
- Future time clauses ✓
- Time sequencing (before, after, then) ✓
- Duration (for, since) ✓

**Batch 3 (11-15): Modal Verbs**
- Should/shouldn't ✓
- Must/have to ✓
- Don't have to vs mustn't ✓
- May/might/could ✓
- Would like ✓

**Batch 4 (16-20): Comparisons**
- Comparative adjectives ✓
- Superlative adjectives ✓
- As...as comparisons ✓
- Adverbs of manner ✓
- Intensifiers (very/too/enough) ✓

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

1. **Conditionals:** Zero and first conditionals completely absent
2. **Connectors:** Only "because" and "so" briefly in Module 9; no comprehensive coverage of but, although, even though
3. **Relative Clauses:** Who, which, that, where not covered at all
4. **Question Formation:** Individual question types scattered across A1/A2 but never integrated systematically
5. **Consolidation:** No comprehensive review/integration module for 20 modules of content

---

### 3. A2 to B1 Transition Research

**Source:** B1-B2 Grammar (LearnEnglish British Council), Wall Street English B1 Grammar Review, CEFR Transition Requirements

**What B1 Requires (that must be founded at A2):**

**Conditionals:**
- A2: Zero and first conditional (general truths, real possibilities)
- B1: Second conditional (hypothetical present/future)
- B1: Third conditional (impossible past)
- **Conclusion:** A2 MUST establish first conditional before B1 second conditional

**Relative Clauses:**
- A2: Defining relative clauses (who, which, that, where)
- B1: Distinguishing defining vs non-defining
- B1: Relative clauses with prepositions
- **Conclusion:** A2 MUST introduce basic relative clauses

**Question Formation:**
- A2: Direct questions (all types)
- B1: Indirect questions ("Can you tell me where...?")
- B1: Question tags
- **Conclusion:** A2 MUST master direct questions before indirect

**Connectors:**
- A2: Simple connectors (because, so, but, although)
- B1: Advanced connectors (however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless)
- **Conclusion:** A2 MUST establish basic connector foundation

**Tenses:**
- A2: Present perfect for experiences
- B1: Present perfect vs past simple distinction (most difficult grammar point)
- **Conclusion:** A2 present perfect foundation adequate; B1 will deepen

### 4. Topic Consideration and Elimination

**Topics Considered for Batch 5:**

| Topic | A2 Required? | Already Covered? | Decision |
|-------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Zero/First Conditional | YES (CEFR explicit) | NO | **INCLUDE - Module 21** |
| Connectors (because/so/but/although) | YES (CEFR: "simple connectors") | Partially (only because) | **INCLUDE - Module 22** |
| Relative Clauses (who/which/that) | YES (CEFR: "relative pronouns") | NO | **INCLUDE - Module 23** |
| Question Formation (comprehensive) | YES (A2 descriptor: "ask and answer") | Scattered, not integrated | **INCLUDE - Module 24** |
| A2 Consolidation | Not CEFR, but essential | NO | **INCLUDE - Module 25** |
| Reported Speech (basic) | NO - B1 level | NO | Reject - Too advanced |
| Second Conditional | NO - B1 level | NO | Reject - Requires first conditional |
| Used to (past habits) | Borderline A2/B1 | NO | Reject - Better for B1 |
| Passive Voice (introduction) | NO - B1 level | NO | Reject - Too advanced |
| Phrasal Verbs (dedicated module) | Partial A2 | Contextually throughout | Reject - Adequate coverage |
| Quantifiers (deeper) | YES but covered | YES (Batch 2, 4) | Reject - Already covered |
| Gerunds/Infinitives (advanced) | NO - B1 level | Basic covered | Reject - B1 topic |

**Final Selection Rationale:**

The 5 selected topics are:
1. The ONLY topics explicitly required by CEFR A2 not yet covered
2. Essential foundations for B1 transition
3. High-frequency, practical communication structures
4. Progressive difficulty suitable for end-of-A2
5. Together, they complete the A2 curriculum comprehensively

### 5. Sequencing Research

**Cognitive Load Theory Application:**

**Principle:** Introduce complex structures when learners have prerequisite knowledge and cognitive capacity.

**Optimal Sequence for Batch 5:**

**1. Conditionals (Module 21) - First**
- Prerequisites: Present simple (A1), future forms (Batch 2)
- Cognitive load: Moderate (two clauses, tense coordination)
- Justification: Enables cause-effect thinking needed for connectors
- Motivation: High (expressing possibilities is engaging)

**2. Connectors (Module 22) - Second**
- Prerequisites: Compound sentences, basic tenses
- Cognitive load: Moderate (punctuation rules, meaning distinctions)
- Justification: Can use conditional sentences as examples
- Builds discourse competence before relative clauses

**3. Relative Clauses (Module 23) - Third**
- Prerequisites: Sentence structure, subject/object understanding
- Cognitive load: High (embedded clauses, pronoun selection)
- Justification: Most complex new structure; benefits from connector knowledge
- Enables sophisticated descriptions in question module

**4. Question Formation (Module 24) - Fourth**
- Prerequisites: ALL A2 grammar (reviews everything)
- Cognitive load: Moderate to high (word order rules across all tenses)
- Justification: Diagnostic function - reveals gaps in learning
- Prepares for Module 25 assessment

**5. Consolidation (Module 25) - Last**
- Prerequisites: All Modules 1-24
- Cognitive load: Integration (using multiple structures together)
- Justification: Provides closure, assessment, and B1 preparation
- Natural conclusion to A2 journey
