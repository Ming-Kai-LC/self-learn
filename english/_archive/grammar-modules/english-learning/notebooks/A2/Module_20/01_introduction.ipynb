    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Use very/really/quite to intensify adjectives and adverbs\n",
    "- Understand 'too' for excessive degree (too expensive, too difficult)\n",
    "- Use 'enough' correctly (adjective + enough, enough + noun)\n",
    "- Distinguish between very (neutral) and too (negative implication)\n",
    "- Combine intensifiers with comparatives for emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Level:** A2\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours\n",
    "**Comparison Focus:** intensifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Formation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- very/really/quite + adj/adv\n",
    "- too + adj\n",
    "- adj + enough\n",

    "### Common Errors to Avoid:\n",
    "- ❌ more better → ✅ better\n",
    "- ❌ more taller → ✅ taller\n",
    "- ❌ She is taller her brother → ✅ She is taller than her brother"
