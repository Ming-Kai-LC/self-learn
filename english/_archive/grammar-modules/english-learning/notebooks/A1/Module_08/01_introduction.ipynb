    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Use adjectives before nouns (a **big** house)\n",
    "- ✅ Use adjectives after 'be' (She **is happy**)\n",
    "- ✅ Know common opposite adjectives (big/small, hot/cold)\n",
    "- ✅ Use color adjectives correctly\n",
    "- ✅ Understand basic adjective order\n",
    "- ✅ Describe people, places, and things accurately\n",

    "### Why Are Adjectives Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjectives make your English **colorful** and **interesting**! Without adjectives, you can only say \"I have a car.\" With adjectives, you can say \"I have a **new red sports car**.\" Adjectives help you describe the world around you!\n",

    "**Adjectives** are words that **describe** or **modify** nouns. They tell us more information about people, places, things, or ideas.\n",

    "| It's a day | It's a **beautiful** day | Quality |\n",
    "| They are students | They are **smart** students | Quality |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjectives give us **MORE INFORMATION** about nouns. They answer questions like:\n",
    "- **What kind?** (a **fast** car)\n",
    "- **What color?** (a **blue** shirt)\n",
    "- **How many?** (**three** books)\n",

    "- Masculine and feminine\n",
    "- Different subjects\n",
