    "❌ I **were** at home. → ✅ I **was** at home.\n",
    "❌ They **was** happy. → ✅ They **were** happy.\n",
    "❌ You **was** late. → ✅ You **were** late. (ALWAYS \"were\" with \"you\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "- WAS = I, he, she, it\n",
    "- WERE = you, we, they\n",

    "### Mistake 2: Using present instead of past\n",
    "❌ Yesterday I **am** tired. → ✅ Yesterday I **was** tired.\n",
    "❌ Last week she **is** here. → ✅ Last week she **was** here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Use past forms when talking about the past!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Wrong negative form\n",
    "❌ I **wasn't not** there. → ✅ I **wasn't** there.\n",
    "❌ He **not was** happy. → ✅ He **wasn't** happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Use \"wasn't\" or \"weren't\" (not \"not irregular verbs\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Wrong question form\n",
    "❌ **Was** they at home? → ✅ **Were** they at home?\n",
    "❌ You **was** at the party? → ✅ **Were** you at the party?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Invert subject and verb for questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 5: Using \"to be\" after irregular verbs\n",
    "❌ I was **to be** tired. → ✅ I was tired.\n",
    "❌ She was **to be** happy. → ✅ She was happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 6: Confusing there irregular verbs with they were\n",
    "❌ **They was** a problem. → ✅ **There was** a problem.\n",
    "❌ **There were** very happy. → ✅ **They were** very happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "- **THERE WAS/WERE** = something existed\n",
    "- **THEY WERE** = plural subject\n",

    "❌ Were you late? - Yes, I were. → ✅ Yes, I was.\n",
    "❌ Was she there? - No, she wasn't was. → ✅ No, she wasn't.\n",
