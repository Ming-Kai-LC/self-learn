    "You've mastered Present Simple (affirmative, negative, and questions). Now you'll learn about **articles** (a, an, the) and **demonstratives** (this, that, these, those)—small but essential words that help you refer to things precisely!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "- ✅ Choose between a and an correctly (a book, an apple)\n",
    "- ✅ Use the definite article \"the\" appropriately\n",
    "- ✅ Know when to use zero article (no article)\n",
    "- ✅ Use this/that for singular items (near/far)\n",
    "- ✅ Use these/those for plural items (near/far)\n",
    "- ✅ Understand the difference between articles and demonstratives\n",
