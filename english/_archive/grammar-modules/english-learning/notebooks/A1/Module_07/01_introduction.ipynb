    "Welcome to **Module 7**! In this module, you'll learn how to show **possession** and **ownership** in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn:\n",
    "- ✅ Possessive adjectives: **my, your, his, her, its, our, their**\n",
    "- ✅ Possessive **'s** with singular nouns (John**'s** book)\n",
    "- ✅ Possessive with names ending in -s (James**'s** / James**'**)\n",
    "- ✅ Possessive with plural nouns (the students**'** books)\n",
    "- ✅ Possessive with irregular plurals (the children**'s** toys)\n",
    "- ✅ **Whose** questions (Whose book is this?)\n",
    "- ✅ **Its** vs **It's** (common mistake!)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Possession** means showing that something **belongs to** someone or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In English, we show possession in TWO main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Possessive Adjectives**:\n",
    "- **My** book (the book belongs to me)\n",
    "- **Your** car (the car belongs to you)\n",
    "- **His** phone (the phone belongs to him)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Possessive 's**:\n",
    "- **John's** book (the book belongs to John)\n",
    "- **Maria's** car (the car belongs to Maria)\n",
    "- **The teacher's** desk (the desk belongs to the teacher)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Possessives Matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ They show **ownership**: \"This is **my** computer\"  \n",
    "✅ They show **relationships**: \"She is **my** sister\"  \n",
    "✅ They make your English more **specific**: \"**John's** idea\" vs \"an idea\"\n",

    "| Subject Pronoun | Possessive Adjective | Example |\n",

    "| **they** | **their** | Those are **their** books. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use possessive adjectives BEFORE a noun**:\n",
    "   - ✅ **My** book is here.\n",
    "   - ❌ ~~Book my is here.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Possessive adjectives NEVER change** (no plural form):\n",
    "   - **my** book (one book)\n",
    "   - **my** books (many books)\n",
    "   - ❌ ~~mys books~~\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Don't use possessive adjectives alone** (they need a noun):\n",
    "   - ❌ ~~This is my.~~\n",
    "   - ✅ This is **mine**. (possessive pronoun - different!)\n",
    "   - ✅ This is **my book**.\n",

    "Is the owner singular?\n",
    "    ↓ YES → Add 's (John's, the teacher's)\n",
