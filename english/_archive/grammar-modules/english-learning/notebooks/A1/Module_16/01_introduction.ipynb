Now you'll learn how to talk about **past ACTIONS**.\n\n### Regular Verbs:\nRegular verbs are verbs that follow a pattern. To make the past simple, we **add -ed** to the base verb.\n\n### Formula:\n```\nBase verb + -ed = Past Simple\n```\n\n### Examples:\n| Base Verb | Past Simple | Meaning |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| play | play**ed** | played |\n| walk | walk**ed** | walked |\n| watch | watch**ed** | watched |\n| listen | listen**ed** | listened |\n| work | work**ed** | worked |\n| help | help**ed** | helped |\n| cook | cook**ed** | cooked |\n| clean | clean**ed** | cleaned |\n\n### Key Point:\n🎯 The past form is the **SAME for all subjects** (I, you, he, she, it, we, they)!\n\n- I play**ed** ✅\n- He play**ed** ✅\n- They play**ed** ✅\n\n---"

Spelling Rules for -ed Endings 📝\n\nMost verbs just add -ed, but there are special spelling rules:\n\n### Rule 1: Most Regular Verbs → Add -ed\nJust add -ed to the base verb:\n\n| Base | Past | Example |\n|------|------|---------|\n| walk | walked | I walked to school. |\n| talk | talked | She talked to me. |\n| play | played | We played games. |\n| watch | watched | He watched TV. |\n| work | worked | They worked hard. |\n\n### Rule 2: Verb ends in -e → Add -d only\nIf the verb already ends in -e, just add -d:\n\n| Base | Past | Example |\n|------|------|---------|\n| like | liked | I liked the movie. |\n| love | loved | She loved the book. |\n| live | lived | We lived in Tokyo. |\n| dance | danced | They danced all night. |\n| use | used | He used my pen. |\n| smile | smiled | She smiled at me. |\n\n### Rule 3: Verb ends in consonant + y → Change y to i, add -ed\n| Base | Past | Example |\n|------|------|---------|\n| study | stud**ied** | I studied English. |\n| try | tr**ied** | She tried hard. |\n| cry | cr**ied** | The baby cried. |\n| carry | carr**ied** | He carried the bags. |\n| worry | worr**ied** | We worried about you. |\n\n**But:** If vowel + y → just add -ed\n- play → played (NOT \"plaied\")\n- enjoy → enjoyed (NOT \"enjoied\")\n\n### Rule 4: One-syllable verb ending in consonant-vowel-consonant → Double the last consonant + -ed\n\n| Base | Past | Example |\n|------|------|---------|\n| stop | sto**pp**ed | I stopped the car. |\n| plan | pla**nn**ed | We planned a trip. |\n| shop | sho**pp**ed | She shopped all day. |\n| drop | dro**pp**ed | He dropped the ball. |\n\n**Exceptions:** Don't double w, x, y\n- show → showed (NOT \"showwed\")\n- fix → fixed (NOT \"fixxed\")\n\n### Rule 5: Two-syllable verbs ending in consonant-vowel-consonant:\n- If stress is on FIRST syllable → don't double\n  - visit → visited (NOT \"visitted\")\n  - open → opened (NOT \"openned\")\n\n- If stress is on SECOND syllable → double it\n  - prefer → preferred\n  - admit → admitted\n\n---"
