## Next Steps

These modules complete the A1 level curriculum. Students will:
1. Master future tense with "going to" (Module 18)
2. Learn "will" for spontaneous decisions and predictions (Module 19)
3. Express frequency of actions accurately (Module 20)

After completing these modules, students will have covered all major A1 grammar points and be ready to progress to A2 level.
