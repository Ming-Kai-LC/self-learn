    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "- ✅ Form negatives using don't and doesn't\n",
    "- ✅ Form Yes/No questions using Do and Does\n",
    "- ✅ Give short answers (Yes, I do / No, I don't)\n",
    "- ✅ Form Wh-questions (What, Where, When, Who, Why, How)\n",
    "- ✅ Use correct word order in questions\n",
