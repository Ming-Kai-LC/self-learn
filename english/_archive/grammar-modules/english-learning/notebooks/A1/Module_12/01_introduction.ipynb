    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "- ✅ Use CAN to express ability (I can swim)\n",
    "- ✅ Use CAN'T to express inability (I can't drive)\n",
    "- ✅ Ask questions with CAN (Can you speak English?)\n",
    "- ✅ Use CAN to ask for and give permission\n",
    "- ✅ Make requests and offers with CAN\n",
    "- ✅ Give short answers (Yes, I can / No, I can't)\n",

    "\n",
    "**CAN** is a **modal verb**. Modal verbs are special helping verbs that change the meaning of the main verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of CAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Same form for all subjects** (no -s for he/she/it):\n",
    "   - I can ✅\n",
    "   - You can ✅\n",
    "   - He/She/It can ✅ (NOT \"cans\")\n",
    "   - We can ✅\n",
    "   - They can ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Followed by base verb** (without \"to\"):\n",
    "   - I can swim ✅ (NOT \"I can to swim\")\n",
    "   - She can dance ✅ (NOT \"She can to dance\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No DO/DOES in questions**:\n",
    "   - Can you swim? ✅ (NOT \"Do you can swim?\")\n",
    "   - Can she dance? ✅ (NOT \"Does she can dance?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Point:\n",
    "CAN is very simple - it **never changes form**!\n",
