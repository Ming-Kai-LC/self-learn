    "✅ **ON for Place:**\n",

    "- Streets (on Main Street)\n",
    "- Public transport (on the bus)\n",

    "- Specific points (at the door, at the corner)\n",
    "- Activities (at work, at school, at home)\n",

    "1. Use **IN** for enclosed spaces and longer time periods\n",
    "2. Use **ON** for surfaces and specific days\n",
    "3. Use **AT** for points/activities and exact times\n",
    "4. Learn fixed expressions (at home, on time, etc.)\n",
    "5. Prepositions are always followed by a noun/pronoun\n",
