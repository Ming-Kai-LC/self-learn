    "## 1. Introduction to Expressing Preferences 💬\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about activities we enjoy or dislike, we use **preference verbs** + **-ing form**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Preference Verbs:\n",
    "| Verb | Meaning | Intensity |\n",
    "|------|---------|-----------|\n",
    "| **LOVE** | Very strong positive feeling | +++ |\n",
    "| **LIKE** | Positive feeling | ++ |\n",
    "| **DON'T MIND** | Neutral/Okay with it | +/- |\n",
    "| **DON'T LIKE** | Negative feeling | -- |\n",
    "| **HATE** | Very strong negative feeling | --- |\n",

    "### Basic Structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Subject + preference verb + -ing + (object/complement)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- I **like reading** books.\n",
    "- She **loves dancing**.\n",
    "- They **hate waiting** in line.\n",
    "- We **enjoy traveling**.\n",
    "- He **doesn't mind cooking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use -ing?\n",
    "When talking about activities in general (not specific instances), we use the **-ing form** (also called a **gerund**). The gerund makes a verb work like a noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compare:**\n",
    "- I like **books**. (noun - thing)\n",
    "- I like **reading**. (gerund - activity)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Point:\n",
    "The -ing form lets you talk about activities as if they were things!\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Softening Negative Opinions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to be less direct:\n",

    "**1. Add \"really\":**\n",
    "- I don't **really** like it. (softer)\n",

    "**Rule:** After LIKE, LOVE, HATE, ENJOY, etc., always use **-ing form**!\n",

    "**LIKE TO + infinitive** = habit/choice\n",
    "- I **like to read** before bed. (I choose to do this)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common mistake:**\n",
    "❌ I like **to reading**.\n",

    "Some learners say:\n",
    "- ❌ I **love** everything!\n",
    "- ❌ I **hate** everything!\n",

    "**Better to vary:**\n",

    "- He/She/It → likes, loves, hates, enjoys\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 13: Using \"FOR\" Incorrectly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding unnecessary \"for\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ I like reading **for** books.\n",
    "[OK] I like reading books.\n",

    "- She loves singing **for** people. (for = audience)\n",

    "**Pronunciation mistake (less serious but common):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ I like **READ**-ing (wrong stress)\n",
    "- [OK] I like **read**-ing (stress on first syllable of root)\n",

    "- ❌ She loves **swim-MING** (wrong stress)\n",
    "- [OK] She loves **SWIM**-ming (stress on first syllable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule:** Usually stress the root verb, not the -ing ending.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Error Check:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before saying/writing your sentence, ask:\n",
    "1. Did I use **-ing** form? ✓\n",
    "2. Did I spell the **-ing** correctly? ✓\n",
    "3. For negatives: Did I use **don't/doesn't**? ✓\n",

    "5. Did I use the right **subject-verb agreement**? ✓\n",
