    "The **Present Simple** is one of the most important tenses in English. We use it to talk about **habits**, **routines**, **facts**, and **things that are generally true**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "- ✅ Form Present Simple affirmative statements for all persons\n",
    "- ✅ Use the critical third-person -s correctly (he/she/it walks)\n",
    "- ✅ Apply spelling rules for -s/-es/-ies endings\n",
    "- ✅ Talk about habits, routines, and facts\n",
    "- ✅ Use adverbs of frequency (always, usually, often, sometimes, never)\n",

    "sleep → sleeps\n",

    "wash → washes\n",
    "watch → watches\n",
    "fix → fixes\n",

    "study → studies\n",
    "try → tries\n",
    "cry → cries\n",
    "fly → flies\n",
