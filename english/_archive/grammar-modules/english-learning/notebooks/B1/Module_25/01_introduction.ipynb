    "Welcome to **Indirect Questions** - THE MOST IMPORTANT B1 STRUCTURE!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this module is special:**\n",
    "- Cambridge English Profile research identifies indirect questions as THE structure that reliably distinguishes B1 from A2 learners\n",
    "- This is not just \"a B1 structure\" - it's **THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC** of B1 level\n",
    "- If you master this module, you have achieved B1 level\n",
    "- If you cannot use indirect questions naturally, you are not yet B1\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to transform direct questions into polite indirect questions\n",
    "- THE CRITICAL RULE: Statement word order (NO inversion!)\n",
    "- When to use if/whether (yes/no questions)\n",
    "- Common polite phrases\n",
    "- Why word order is EVERYTHING\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Much more polite than direct questions\n",
    "- Native speakers use these constantly\n",
    "- Essential for professional/formal contexts\n",
    "- THE hallmark of B1 level\n",
    "\n",
    "**The transformation:**\n",
    "- Direct: \"Where is the station?\"\n",
    "- Indirect: \"Can you tell me where the station is?\" (statement order!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This module will take 7-8 hours.** This is THE most important B1 module!\n"

    "## 2. The Critical Rule - STATEMENT WORD ORDER\n",
    "\n",
    "**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE IN ALL OF B1!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Questions (Question Order)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inversion:** Verb comes BEFORE subject\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- \"Where **is** the station?\" (is = verb, station = subject)\n",
    "- \"What **does** she want?\" (does = auxiliary, she = subject)\n",
    "- \"Why **did** he leave?\" (did = auxiliary, he = subject)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indirect Questions (Statement Order)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NO Inversion:** Subject comes BEFORE verb\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- \"Can you tell me where **the station is**?\" (station = subject, is = verb)\n",
    "- \"Do you know what **she wants**?\" (she = subject, wants = verb - NO \"does\"!)\n",
    "- \"I wonder why **he left**?\" (he = subject, left = verb - NO \"did\"!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pattern\n",
    "\n",

    "✅ \"Can you tell me where the station **is**?\"\n",

    "✅ \"Do you know what she **wants**?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ \"I wonder why **did** he leave?\"\n",
    "✅ \"I wonder why he **left**?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** In indirect questions, use STATEMENT word order - NO inversion!\n"

    "### The Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct → Indirect:**\n",
    "1. Choose polite phrase: \"Can you tell me...?\"\n",
    "2. Add wh-word (or if/whether for yes/no)\n",
    "3. **Change to STATEMENT word order** [KEY STEP]\n",
    "4. Remove do/does/did\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wh- Questions:**\n",
    "- Direct: \"Where is it?\" → Indirect: \"Do you know where it **is**?\"\n",
    "- Direct: \"What does she want?\" → Indirect: \"Can you tell me what she **wants**?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes/No Questions:**\n",
    "- Direct: \"Is the bank open?\" → Indirect: \"Do you know **if** the bank **is** open?\"\n",
    "- Direct: \"Does she speak English?\" → Indirect: \"Can you tell me **if** she **speaks** English?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Polite Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can you tell me...?\n",
    "- Do you know...?\n",
    "- Could you tell me...?\n",
    "- I wonder...\n",
