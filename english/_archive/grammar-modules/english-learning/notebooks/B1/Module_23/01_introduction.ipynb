    "Welcome to **Make, Let, Help, Get - Causative Patterns** - expressing how to get people to do things!\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Make + object + base verb (force)\n",
    "- Let + object + base verb (allow)\n",
    "- Help + object + (to) base verb (assist)\n",
    "- Get + object + to infinitive (persuade)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Each verb has different pattern (with/without \"to\")\n",
    "- Different meanings (force vs allow vs persuade)\n",
    "- Very common in everyday English\n",
    "- Critical for describing influence on others\n",
