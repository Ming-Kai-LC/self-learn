    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Used to + base verb (past habits and states)\n",
    "- Would + base verb (repeated past actions only)\n",
    "- Be used to + -ing (being accustomed)\n",
    "- Get used to + -ing (becoming accustomed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- These look similar but mean VERY different things\n",
    "- Extremely common in everyday English\n",
    "- Native speakers use all four constantly\n",
    "- Critical for describing past habits and current habits\n",
