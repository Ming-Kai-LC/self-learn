    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Verbs that take ONLY gerund (-ing)\n",
    "- Verbs that take ONLY infinitive (to + base)\n",
    "- Verbs that take BOTH (no meaning change)\n",
    "- Verbs that take BOTH (meaning CHANGES!) [CRITICAL]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- No single rule - must learn each verb's pattern\n",
    "- Some verbs completely change meaning!\n",
    "- Essential for natural English\n",
    "- Very common errors even at B2 level\n",
