    "**Past tense = Psychological distance from reality**\n",

    "- Real (first conditional): \"If it **rains**, I **will** stay home.\" (might really happen)\n",

    "| Conditional | Reality Level | Example |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------|---------|\n",
    "| **First** | Real possibility | If I **have** time, I **will** help. (I might have time) |\n",
    "| **Second** | Unreal/unlikely | If I **had** time, I **would** help. (I don't have time) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The past tense creates distance from reality!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern exists in many languages - using past tense to signal politeness or unreality:\n",
    "- \"Could you help me?\" (more polite than \"Can you help me?\")\n",
