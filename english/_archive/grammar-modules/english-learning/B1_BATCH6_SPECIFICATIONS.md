## Module 26: Question Tags

**Full Title:** Question Tags - Aren't You? Doesn't He?
**Subtitle:** Interactive Confirmation Questions
**Grammar Focus:** Formation, Meaning, and Intonation
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Exercise Count:** 90
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate - pattern recognition)

### Core Concept

**Question tags:** Short questions added to the end of statements to confirm or ask for agreement

**Structure:** Statement + auxiliary verb (opposite polarity) + pronoun?

**Examples:**
- "You're a student, **aren't you**?"
- "He doesn't like coffee, **does he**?"
- "They went home, **didn't they**?"

### Formation Rules

**Rule 1: Opposite Polarity**
- Positive statement → Negative tag
  - "You **like** pizza, **don't** you?"
- Negative statement → Positive tag
  - "You **don't like** pizza, **do** you?"

**Rule 2: Match the Auxiliary**
- Use the auxiliary from the statement
  - "He **is** working, **isn't** he?"
  - "She **can** swim, **can't** she?"
  - "They **have** finished, **haven't** they?"

**Rule 3: Add "do/does/did" if no auxiliary**
- "She **likes** coffee, **doesn't** she?" (present simple → does)
- "He **went** home, **didn't** he?" (past simple → did)

**Rule 4: Use pronoun in tag**
- "Your sister lives here, doesn't **she**?" (NOT "doesn't your sister")
- "The car is red, isn't **it**?" (NOT "isn't the car")

### Special Cases

**With "I am":**
- "I'm right, **aren't I**?" (NOT "amn't I" - doesn't exist!)

**With "Let's":**
- "Let's go, **shall we**?"

**With imperatives:**
- "Open the door, **will you**?" / "**would you**?" / "**can you**?"

**With "there is/are":**
- "There's a problem, **isn't there**?"

**With "nothing/nobody" (negative meaning):**
- "Nothing happened, **did it**?" (positive tag - "nothing" is already negative)
- "Nobody came, **did they**?" (positive tag)

### Intonation - Changes Meaning!

**Falling intonation (↓):**
- Confirming something you believe is true
- Not really a question
- "You're from Spain, aren't you? ↓" (I'm pretty sure)

**Rising intonation (↑):**
- Real question - you don't know
- Asking for information
- "You're from Spain, aren't you? ↑" (I don't know, asking)

### Usage Patterns

**1. Confirming information:**
- "The meeting is at 3pm, isn't it?"

**2. Making conversation:**
- "Nice weather today, isn't it?"

**3. Asking for agreement:**
- "That movie was great, wasn't it?"

**4. Checking understanding:**
- "You understand, don't you?"

**5. Being polite (softening):**
- "You wouldn't mind helping, would you?"

### Common Errors

- ❌ "You like pizza, don't **he**?" → ✅ "don't **you**?" (pronoun match)
- ❌ "He is working, **doesn't he**?" → ✅ "**isn't he**?" (match auxiliary)
- ❌ "I am right, **am I not**?" → ✅ "**aren't I**?" (special form)
- ❌ "Let's go, **don't we**?" → ✅ "**shall we**?" (special form)

**Subtitle:** So That, In Order To, So...That, Such...That
**Grammar Focus:** Expressing Purpose and Result Relationships
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Exercise Count:** 85
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate - structure learning)

### Core Concept

**Purpose clauses:** Why we do something (intention)
**Result clauses:** What happened because of something (consequence)

### Purpose Clauses - "Why?"

**To + infinitive (most common):**
- "I study **to** improve my English." (purpose: improve)
- "She works **to** earn money."

**In order to + infinitive (more formal):**
- "I study **in order to** improve my English."
- "He saved money **in order to** buy a car."

**So that + subject + modal (can/will/would):**
- "I study **so that** I **can** improve my English."
- "She left early **so that** she **wouldn't** be late."
- Key: Need subject + modal verb!

**So as to + infinitive (formal, less common):**
- "I arrived early **so as to** get a good seat."

### Negative Purpose - "To avoid"

**To avoid + -ing:**
- "I left early **to avoid** being late."

### Result Clauses - "What happened?"

- Structure: so + adj/adv + that + result

**Such + (adjective) + noun + that:**

- Structure: such + (adj) + noun + that + result

**So much/many + that:**
- "I ate **so much that** I felt sick." (uncountable)
- "She has **so many friends that** her house is always full." (countable)

**So + that (informal):**
- "I was tired, **so** I went to bed." (informal - no "that")
- Note: Not the same as "so that" for purpose!

### So vs Such - The Difference

**So + adjective/adverb:**
- "It's **so hot**!" (so + adjective)
- "He works **so hard**!" (so + adverb)

**Such + noun (with/without adjective):**
- "It's **such a hot day**!" (such + adj + noun)
- "He's **such a hard worker**!" (such + adj + noun)
- "It was **such fun**!" (such + noun - no article with uncountable)

### Common Confusions

**Purpose (future-looking intention) vs Result (consequence):**
- Purpose: "I saved money **to buy** a car." (intention)
- Result: "I saved **so much money that** I bought a car." (consequence)

**So that (purpose) vs So... that (result):**
- Purpose: "I studied **so that** I **could** pass." (so that + modal)
- Result: "The test was **so easy that** everyone passed." (so + adj + that)

### Formality

## Module 29: Contrast Clauses - Advanced

**Full Title:** Contrast Clauses - Advanced Patterns
**Subtitle:** While, Whereas, In Spite Of, Despite
**Grammar Focus:** Complex Contrast Expressions
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Exercise Count:** 85
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate - pattern variety)

### Core Concept

**Contrast:** Showing difference or unexpected situations

**Types:**
1. **Concession:** Despite a problem, something happens (in spite of, despite, although)
2. **Comparison contrast:** Comparing two different things (while, whereas)
3. **Unexpected result:** Opposite of expectation (even though, still, yet)

### Although / Though / Even Though - Concession

**Although + clause:**
- "**Although** I studied, I failed." (unexpected result)
- "**Although** it was raining, we went out."

**Though (less formal, same meaning):**
- "**Though** I studied, I failed."
- Can come at end (informal): "I failed, **though** I studied."

**Even though (stronger):**
- Emphasizes unexpectedness
- "**Even though** I studied for weeks, I still failed."

**Structure:** Although/though/even though + subject + verb, main clause.

### Despite / In Spite Of - Concession with Noun

**Despite + noun/-ing:**
- "**Despite** the rain, we went out."
- "**Despite** studying hard, I failed."
- "**Despite** his age, he's very active."

**In spite of + noun/-ing (same meaning, slightly less formal):**
- "**In spite of** the rain, we went out."
- "**In spite of** studying hard, I failed."

**Key difference from although:**
- Although + clause (subject + verb)
- Despite/in spite of + noun or -ing (NO subject + verb!)

**Common error:**
- ❌ "Despite I studied hard..."
- ✅ "Despite studying hard..." or "Although I studied hard..."

### Despite the fact that / In spite of the fact that

**If you want "despite/in spite of" + clause:**
- Use "the fact that"
- "**Despite the fact that** I studied, I failed."
- "**In spite of the fact that** it was raining, we went out."

### While / Whereas - Comparison Contrast

**While + clause:**
- Compare two different/opposite things
- "**While** I like coffee, my sister prefers tea." (different preferences)
- "**While** he's tall, she's short." (contrast)

**Whereas (more formal):**
- Same meaning as while
- "**Whereas** I like coffee, my sister prefers tea."
- More common in written/formal English

**vs "although":**
- Although: unexpected result
- While/whereas: simple comparison/difference

Examples:
- "**Although** I like coffee, I drink tea." (unexpected - you'd expect I drink coffee)
- "**While** I like coffee, my sister likes tea." (just comparing - no unexpectedness)

### Yet / Still / Nevertheless - Unexpected Result

**Yet (conjunction):**
- "I studied hard, **yet** I failed." (formal)
- Same as "but" but more formal

**Still (adverb):**
- "I studied hard. I **still** failed."
- "It was raining. We **still** went out."

**Nevertheless (formal discourse marker):**
- "I studied hard. **Nevertheless**, I failed."
- Very formal, written English

### However vs Although

**Common confusion!**

**Although (conjunction - connects in one sentence):**
- "**Although** it was raining, we went out."

**However (discourse marker - separate sentences):**
- "It was raining. **However**, we went out."

**Error:**
- ❌ "However it was raining, we went out."
- ✅ "Although it was raining, we went out."

### Summary of Contrast Structures

| Structure | + Clause | + Noun/-ing | Formality | Type |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| although | ✅ | ❌ | Neutral | Concession |
| though | ✅ | ❌ | Informal | Concession |
| even though | ✅ | ❌ | Neutral | Strong concession |
| despite | ❌ | ✅ | Neutral | Concession |
