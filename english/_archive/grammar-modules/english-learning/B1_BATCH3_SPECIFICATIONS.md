# B1 Level - Batch 3: Passive Voice and Reporting
## Modules 11-15 - Detailed Specifications

**Batch Theme:** Voice Transformations and Reported Speech
**Development Priority:** HIGH - Essential for formal/academic writing and communication
**Total Modules:** 5
**Total Notebooks:** 20 (5 modules × 4 phases)
**Total Exercises:** ~455
**Estimated Learning Time:** 27-31 hours
**CEFR Alignment:** B1.2-B1.3 (Mid to Upper-Intermediate B1)

---

## Overview

Batch 3 focuses on two critical B1 structures:
1. **Passive Voice** - Shifting focus from actor to action/receiver
2. **Reported Speech** - Retelling what others said

Both structures are essential for:
- Academic and formal writing
- News reporting and journalism
- Professional communication
- Storytelling and narrative
- B1 level competency

### Why Passive Voice and Reporting for Batch 3?

1. **Natural Progression:** Requires solid tense mastery (Batch 1) and complex structures (Batch 2)
2. **High Utility:** Used extensively in academic, professional, and news contexts
3. **B1 Requirement:** Passive voice (simple tenses) is criterial for B1
4. **Form Transformation:** Both involve systematic form changes
5. **Integration Opportunity:** Uses all tenses from Batch 1

### Pedagogical Approach

- **When to Use:** Focus on WHEN and WHY, not just HOW
- **Agent Analysis:** Understanding when to include/omit by-phrase
- **Systematic Backshift:** Clear rules for tense changes in reporting
- **Transformation Practice:** Active ↔ Passive, Direct ↔ Reported
- **Authentic Contexts:** News articles, academic texts, conversations
- **Progressive Complexity:** Simple passive → Complex passive → Basic reporting → Advanced reporting

## Module 11: Passive Voice - Present and Past Simple

**Full Title:** Passive Voice Introduction - Present and Past Simple
**Subtitle:** Be + Past Participle - Focus on Action, Not Actor
**Grammar Focus:** Passive voice formation and usage in simple tenses
**Estimated Time:** 6-7 hours
**Exercise Count:** 95 (high - foundation for all passive)
**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆ (Challenging - new voice concept)

### Core Concept

Passive voice shifts focus from WHO does the action (actor/agent) to WHAT receives the action or the action itself.

**Active:** The chef **cooked** the meal. (focus on chef)
**Passive:** The meal **was cooked** by the chef. (focus on meal)

**Formation:** be + past participle (+ by agent)

**Key Uses:**
1. **Agent unknown:** "My car was stolen." (don't know who)
2. **Agent obvious:** "The president was elected." (by voters - obvious)
3. **Agent unimportant:** "English is spoken here." (who speaks not important)
4. **Focus on receiver:** "The building was destroyed." (emphasize building)
5. **Formal/academic style:** "The experiment was conducted..."

### Present Simple Passive

**Formation:** am/is/are + past participle

**Examples:**
- "English **is spoken** in many countries."
- "These cars **are made** in Germany."
- "I **am paid** monthly."

**When to use:**
- General facts: "Rice is grown in Asia."
- Regular actions: "The office is cleaned every day."
- States: "This room is used for meetings."

### Past Simple Passive

**Formation:** was/were + past participle

**Examples:**
- "The building **was built** in 1920."
- "The students **were tested** yesterday."
- "I **was born** in Tokyo."

**When to use:**
- Completed past actions: "The letter was sent last week."
- Historical events: "The city was founded in 1850."
- Past states: "The building was used as a hospital."

### By-Phrase (Agent)

**When to include:**
- Agent is important/surprising: "The book was written by a child."
- Agent is specific person: "Romeo and Juliet was written by Shakespeare."
- Contrast: "This one was painted by Picasso, that one by Monet."

**When to omit:**
- Agent unknown: "My bike was stolen." (don't know who)
- Agent obvious: "The president was elected." (obviously by voters)
- Agent unimportant: "The house was built in 1990." (who built it not relevant)
- Agent is "people in general": "Spanish is spoken in Spain." (not "by people")

## Module 13: Reported Speech - Say and Tell Statements

**Full Title:** Reported Speech Introduction - Statements
**Subtitle:** He Said (That)... - Reporting What People Said
**Grammar Focus:** Reported statements with tense backshift
**Estimated Time:** 6-7 hours
**Exercise Count:** 95 (high - complex transformation)
**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆ (Challenging - systematic changes required)

### Core Concept

Reporting what someone said using tense backshift and word changes.

**Direct Speech:** She said, "I am tired."
**Reported Speech:** She said (that) she was tired.

**Changes Required:**
1. **Pronouns:** I → she/he, we → they
2. **Tenses:** Backshift (present → past, past → past perfect)
3. **Time words:** today → that day, tomorrow → the next day
4. **Place words:** here → there
5. **Demonstratives:** this → that, these → those

### Say vs Tell

**Say:**
- No object: "He **said** (that) he was busy."
- Say to someone: "He **said to me** (that) he was busy."
- More common in reported speech

**Tell:**
- Requires object: "He **told me** (that) he was busy."
- Cannot use "to": ❌ "He told to me..."
- More direct

### Tense Backshift Rules

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Present simple → | Past simple |
| Present continuous → | Past continuous |
| Present perfect → | Past perfect |
| Past simple → | Past perfect |
| Past continuous → | Past continuous/past perfect continuous |
| Will → | Would |
| Can → | Could |
| May → | Might |
| Must → | Had to |

**No backshift needed when:**
- General truths: "The earth goes around the sun" → He said the earth goes around the sun.
- Still true now: "I live in London" → He said he lives in London. (if still true)
- Reporting immediately: "I'm tired" → She says she's tired. (using present 'says')

### Time and Place Changes

| Direct | Reported |
|--------|----------|
| today | that day |
| tonight | that night |
| tomorrow | the next day / the following day |
| yesterday | the day before / the previous day |
| last week | the week before / the previous week |
| next week | the following week / the week after |
| ago | before |
| now | then / at that time |
| here | there |
| this | that |
| these | those |
