## Why These Topics?

### Gap Analysis Results:

**What's Missing from Modules 1-20:**
✗ Conditionals (zero/first) - CEFR requirement
✗ Comprehensive connectors - only "because" briefly covered
✗ Relative clauses - essential A2 descriptive structure
✗ Integrated question formation - scattered across levels
✗ Systematic consolidation - needed for 25-module retention

**CEFR A2 Requirements Not Yet Met:**
- "Conditionals - zero and 1st"
- "Link groups of words with simple connectors"
- "Use relative pronouns for definitions"
- "Ask and answer questions" (comprehensively)

### What This Batch Achieves:

✓ Completes ALL CEFR A2 grammar requirements
✓ Fills critical gaps in current curriculum
✓ Integrates all 25 A2 modules systematically
✓ Prepares for B1 transition (second conditional, indirect questions, etc.)
✓ Provides comprehensive self-assessment

---

## Optimal Sequence Rationale

**Why This Order:**

1. **Conditionals First:** Builds on future forms, enables possibility expression
2. **Connectors Second:** Uses conditionals, develops discourse competence
3. **Relative Clauses Third:** Most complex structure, benefits from connector knowledge
4. **Questions Fourth:** Reviews ALL A2 grammar in question form, diagnostic function
5. **Consolidation Last:** Integrates everything, assesses readiness, provides closure

Each module builds on previous modules within the batch AND across all batches.
