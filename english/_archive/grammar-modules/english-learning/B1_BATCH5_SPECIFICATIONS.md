## Overview

Batch 5 is the **most important B1 batch** because it contains:
1. Advanced verb complementation patterns
2. Causative structures
3. Complex phrasal verbs
4. **THE CRITERIAL B1 FEATURE: Indirect Questions (Module 25)** ⭐

**Module 25 is special:** Cambridge English Profile research identifies indirect questions ("Can you tell me where the station is?") as THE structure that reliably distinguishes B1 learners from A2 learners. This is not just "a B1 structure" - it's **THE defining characteristic** of B1 level.

### Why This Batch is Critical

1. **Criterial Feature:** Module 25 contains THE B1 hallmark structure
2. **High Utility:** All structures used extensively in daily English
3. **Complex Patterns:** Requires integration of all previous grammar
4. **Natural Speech:** Essential for sounding natural in English
5. **Completion Gateway:** After this batch, only consolidation remains

### Pedagogical Approach

- **Pattern Recognition:** Multiple verb patterns systematically learned
- **Meaning Distinctions:** Subtle meaning differences (used to vs would vs be used to)
- **Causative Logic:** Understanding how to express getting others to act
- **Embedded Clause Mastery:** Critical for Module 25
- **Integration:** Combines all Batches 1-4 grammar
- **Progressive Intensity:** Building to the criterial feature in Module 25

## Module 21: Used To, Would, and Be/Get Used To

**Full Title:** Used To, Would, and Be/Get Used To
**Subtitle:** Past Habits vs Being Accustomed
**Grammar Focus:** Distinguishing three commonly confused structures
**Estimated Time:** 6-7 hours
**Exercise Count:** 95 (high - frequently confused)
**Difficulty:** ★★★★☆ (Challenging - subtle distinctions)

### Core Concept

Three different structures that learners constantly confuse:

**1. Used to + base verb:** Past habits and states (no longer true)
**2. Would + base verb:** Repeated past actions only (NOT states)
**3. Be used to + -ing:** Accustomed to something (present or past)
**4. Get used to + -ing:** Become accustomed (process)

### Used To - Past Habits and States

**Formation:** used to + base verb

**Meaning:** Something was true in the past but is NOT true now

**Uses:**
1. **Past habits:** "I **used to smoke**, but I quit." (past habit, stopped)
2. **Past states:** "I **used to live** in London." (past state, no longer)
3. **Past situations:** "There **used to be** a cinema here." (no longer exists)

**Key:** Always implies change - it WAS true, but ISN'T now

**Examples:**
- "I **used to play** tennis every day." (don't anymore)
- "She **used to be** a teacher." (isn't anymore)
- "We **used to have** a dog." (don't anymore)

**Question/Negative:**
- Question: "Did you **use to** smoke?" (NOT "used to")
- Negative: "I **didn't use to** like coffee." (NOT "didn't used to")

### Would - Repeated Past Actions Only

**Formation:** would + base verb

**Meaning:** Repeated actions in the past (typically nostalgic)

**Uses:**
- ONLY for **repeated actions**, NOT states
- Often with time phrases: "Every summer, we **would go** to the beach."
- Cannot use for states (❌ "I would be happy" ✗)

**Examples:**
- "When I was young, I **would visit** my grandmother every Sunday."
- "We **would spend** hours playing in the park."
- "He **would always forget** his keys."

**vs Used To:**
- Used to: habits AND states
- Would: ONLY repeated actions (NOT states)
- "I **used to be** happy." ✅ (state)
- "I **would be** happy." ❌ (cannot use would for states)

### Be Used To + -ing - Being Accustomed

**Formation:** be used to + -ing (or noun)

**Meaning:** Be accustomed to something (familiar, normal for you)

**NOT about past!** This is about what you're accustomed to (present or past)

**Examples:**
- "I'**m used to working** late." (it's normal for me - I'm accustomed)
- "She**'s used to** the cold weather." (accustomed to it)
- "We**'re used to eating** spicy food." (we're accustomed)

**Can be past:**
- "I **was used to** living alone." (I was accustomed to it)

### Get Used To + -ing - Becoming Accustomed

**Formation:** get used to + -ing (or noun)

**Meaning:** BECOME accustomed (the process of getting accustomed)

**Examples:**
- "I'm **getting used to** my new job." (becoming accustomed - process)
- "It took me a while to **get used to** driving on the left." (becoming accustomed)
- "You'll **get used to** the noise." (you'll become accustomed)

### The Four Structures Compared

| Structure | Meaning | Time | Form | Example |
|-----------|---------|------|------|---------|
| **Used to** | Past habit/state (not now) | Past | used to + base | I used to smoke |
| **Would** | Repeated past action only | Past | would + base | I would visit her |
| **Be used to** | Accustomed to | Present/Past | be used to + -ing | I'm used to it |
| **Get used to** | Become accustomed | Any time | get used to + -ing | I'm getting used to it |

## Module 22: Gerunds and Infinitives - Advanced Patterns

**Full Title:** Gerunds and Infinitives - Advanced Verb Complementation
**Subtitle:** Verbs Followed by -ing or To + Infinitive
**Grammar Focus:** Verb patterns and meaning changes
**Estimated Time:** 6-7 hours
**Exercise Count:** 95 (high - complex patterns)
**Difficulty:** ★★★★★ (Very challenging - many patterns, meaning changes)

### Core Concept

Different verbs require different patterns:
1. **Verb + gerund (-ing)** only
2. **Verb + infinitive (to + base)** only
3. **Verb + both** (no meaning change)
4. **Verb + both** (meaning CHANGES!)

### Verbs + Gerund Only

**Common verbs:** enjoy, finish, mind, avoid, suggest, recommend, consider, practice, deny, admit, miss, risk, can't help

**Examples:**
- "I **enjoy reading**." (NOT "enjoy to read")
- "She **finished working** at 5pm."
- "Do you **mind closing** the window?"
- "He **avoided answering** the question."

### Verbs + Infinitive Only

**Common verbs:** want, need, decide, plan, hope, expect, agree, refuse, offer, promise, seem, appear, afford, manage

**Examples:**
- "I **want to go**." (NOT "want going")
- "She **decided to study** medicine."
- "They **agreed to help**."
- "We can't **afford to buy** it."

### Verbs + Both (No Meaning Change)

**Common verbs:** like, love, hate, prefer, begin, start, continue

**Examples:**
- "I **like swimming**." = "I **like to swim**." (same meaning)
- "She **started working**." = "She **started to work**."
- "We **continue studying**." = "We **continue to study**."

**Note:** In some contexts, infinitive sounds more formal or specific

### Verbs + Both (MEANING CHANGES!) - CRITICAL

These are the most important - the meaning CHANGES:

**1. Stop**
- **Stop + -ing:** Stop the activity
  - "I **stopped smoking**." (quit smoking)
- **Stop + to infinitive:** Stop in order to do something else
  - "I **stopped to smoke**." (paused what I was doing to have a cigarette)

**2. Remember**
- **Remember + -ing:** Remember a past action
  - "I **remember meeting** him." (I have a memory of meeting him)
- **Remember + to infinitive:** Remember to do something (future)
  - "I **remembered to call** her." (I didn't forget to call)

**3. Forget**
- **Forget + -ing:** Forget a past event
  - "I'll never **forget visiting** Paris." (memory of past)
- **Forget + to infinitive:** Fail to remember to do something
  - "I **forgot to call** her." (I didn't call - I forgot)

**4. Try**
- **Try + -ing:** Experiment with something
  - "I **tried eating** less." (experimented with this method)
- **Try + to infinitive:** Attempt/make an effort
  - "I **tried to eat** less." (made an effort, might not have succeeded)

**5. Regret**
- **Regret + -ing:** Regret a past action
  - "I **regret telling** him." (I told him, now I regret it)
- **Regret + to infinitive:** Be sorry to say (formal)
  - "I **regret to inform** you..." (formal announcement)

### Gerund as Subject/Object

## Module 23: Make, Let, Help, Get - Causative Patterns

**Full Title:** Make, Let, Help, Get - Causative Verb Patterns
**Subtitle:** Getting People to Do Things
**Grammar Focus:** Causative structures
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Exercise Count:** 90
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate - clear patterns)

### Core Concept

Causative verbs express getting someone/something to do something:

**Make:** Force someone to do something
**Let:** Allow/permit someone to do something
**Help:** Assist someone to do something
**Get:** Persuade/arrange for someone to do something

### Make + Object + Infinitive (WITHOUT to)

**Meaning:** Force, compel (no choice)

**Formation:** make + object + base verb (NO "to")

**Examples:**
- "My parents **made me study**." (forced, no choice)
- "The teacher **makes us do** homework." (requires)
- "Don't **make me laugh**!" (causing)

**Passive:** be made + to infinitive (WITH "to")
- "I **was made to study**." (passive form)

### Let + Object + Infinitive (WITHOUT to)

**Meaning:** Allow, permit (give permission)

**Formation:** let + object + base verb (NO "to")

**Examples:**
- "My parents **let me go** to the party." (gave permission)
- "Please **let me help** you." (allow)
- "She **won't let me use** her car." (won't allow)

**No passive form:** Use "be allowed to" instead
- ❌ "I was let to go"
- ✅ "I was allowed to go"

### Help + Object + Infinitive (WITH or WITHOUT to)

**Meaning:** Assist, aid

**Formation:** help + object + base verb OR to + base verb (BOTH OK)

**Examples:**
- "I **helped him carry** the bags." (no "to")
- "I **helped him to carry** the bags." (with "to")
- Both are correct!

**Without object:** "Can you **help**?" or "Can you **help to**?"

### Get + Object + To Infinitive (WITH to)

**Meaning:** Persuade, convince, arrange

**Formation:** get + object + to + base verb (WITH "to")

**Examples:**
- "I **got him to help** me." (persuaded)
- "She **got me to change** my mind." (convinced)
- "Can you **get them to come** early?" (arrange)

**vs Make:** Make = force (no choice); Get = persuade (they agree)

### Have/Get Something Done (Causative Passive)

**Advanced pattern:** Have/get + object + past participle

**Meaning:** Arrange for someone else to do something for you

**Examples:**
- "I **had my car repaired**." (someone repaired it for me)
- "She **got her hair cut**." (at a salon)
- "We're **having the house painted**." (hiring painters)

**Note:** This is advanced B1/B2 - introduce here

### The Four Causatives Compared

## Module 24: Phrasal Verbs - Three-Particle Verbs

**Full Title:** Phrasal Verbs - Three-Particle Verbs and Expansion
**Subtitle:** Look Forward To, Get On With, Put Up With
**Grammar Focus:** Complex phrasal verb structures
**Estimated Time:** 5-6 hours
**Exercise Count:** 85
**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (Moderate - vocabulary learning)

### Core Concept

**Three-particle phrasal verbs:** verb + adverb + preposition

**Examples:**
- look forward to
- get on with
- put up with
- run out of
- come up with
- get away with

**Characteristics:**
- Three words acting as one verb
- ALWAYS inseparable (cannot put object between particles)

### Common Three-Particle Verbs

**Look forward to + -ing/noun:** Anticipate with pleasure
- "I'm **looking forward to seeing** you."
- "We're **looking forward to** the weekend."

**Get on with:** Continue doing, have good relationship

- Some inseparable: "I **look after** my sister." (NOT "look my sister after")

**Three-particle phrasal verbs:**
- ALWAYS inseparable
- "I **look forward to it**." ✅
- ❌ "I look it forward to." ✗

### With Gerund or Noun

Many three-particle verbs take specific patterns:

- "Look forward to + -ing/noun"

## Module 25: Indirect Questions - THE CRITERIAL B1 FEATURE ⭐

**Full Title:** Indirect Questions - Can You Tell Me...?
**Subtitle:** Polite Question Formation with Embedded Clauses
**Grammar Focus:** THE CRITERIAL B1 FEATURE - Embedded Questions
**Estimated Time:** 7-8 hours (CRITICAL MODULE)
**Exercise Count:** 100 (HIGHEST - this is THE B1 hallmark)
**Difficulty:** ★★★★★ (Maximum - hallmark structure)

### Why This Module is Special

**Cambridge English Profile Research:** Indirect questions are THE structure that reliably distinguishes B1 from A2 learners. This is not just "a B1 structure" - it's **THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC** of B1 level.

If you master this module, you have achieved B1 level. If you cannot use indirect questions naturally, you are not yet B1, regardless of other grammar knowledge.

### Core Concept

**Indirect (Embedded) Questions:** Questions inside statements or polite questions

**Direct Question:** "Where is the station?"
**Indirect Question:** "Can you tell me **where the station is**?"

**KEY CHANGE:** Word order changes from question to statement order (no inversion!)

### Why Use Indirect Questions?

1. **Politeness:** Much more polite than direct questions
2. **Formality:** Appropriate in professional settings
3. **Natural English:** Native speakers use these constantly
4. **B1 Hallmark:** THE defining B1 structure

### Structure with Wh- Questions

**Pattern:** Polite phrase + wh-word + subject + verb (STATEMENT ORDER!)

**Direct:** "Where **is** the station?"
**Indirect:** "Can you tell me where the station **is**?" (no inversion!)

**Common polite phrases:**
- Can you tell me...?
- Do you know...?
- Could you tell me...?
- I wonder...
- I'd like to know...
- Do you have any idea...?

**Examples:**
- Direct: "What time **is** it?"
- Indirect: "Do you know what time **it is**?"

- Direct: "Where **does** she live?"
- Indirect: "Can you tell me where she **lives**?" (no "does"!)

- Direct: "Why **did** he leave?"
- Indirect: "I wonder why he **left**?" (no "did"!)

### Structure with Yes/No Questions

**Pattern:** Polite phrase + if/whether + subject + verb

**Direct:** "**Is** the bank open?"
**Indirect:** "Do you know **if the bank is** open?"

**Direct:** "**Does** she speak English?"
**Indirect:** "Can you tell me **if she speaks** English?"

**If vs Whether:**
- Both are correct
- "Whether" slightly more formal
- "If" more common in speech

### The Critical Rule: STATEMENT WORD ORDER

**Direct questions have inversion (verb before subject):**
- "Where **is** he?" (is = verb, he = subject → inverted)
- "What **did** you do?" (did = auxiliary, you = subject → inverted)

**Indirect questions have STATEMENT order (subject before verb):**
- "...where **he is**" (he = subject, is = verb → statement order)
- "...what **you did**" (you = subject, did = auxiliary → statement order)

**This is THE most important rule!**

### Common Errors (CRITICAL TO AVOID)

❌ "Can you tell me where **is** the station?"
✅ "Can you tell me where the station **is**?"

❌ "Do you know what **does** she want?"
✅ "Do you know what she **wants**?"

❌ "I wonder why **did** he leave?"
✅ "I wonder why he **left**?"

### Advanced: Negative Indirect Questions

**Direct:** "Why **didn't** she come?"
**Indirect:** "I wonder why she **didn't come**." (keep didn't, but statement order)

### Advanced: Modal Verbs in Indirect Questions

**Direct:** "Where **can** I buy tickets?"
**Indirect:** "Do you know where **I can buy** tickets?" (statement order)

### I Wonder vs Do You Know

**I wonder:** Often doesn't need an answer (thinking aloud)
- "I wonder where he is..." (not really asking)

**Do you know / Can you tell me:** Clearly asking for information
- "Do you know where he is?" (requesting information)

### Phase 1: Introduction (20 sections) - COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE

    - Statement order with negatives
    - Double-check word order

13. **Modal Verbs in Indirect Questions**
    - Can, could, should, will, would
