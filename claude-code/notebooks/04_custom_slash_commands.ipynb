    "## 1. Introduction to Slash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Slash Commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "Slash commands are **custom shortcuts** that let you trigger specific prompts in Claude Code by typing `/command-name`. Think of them as customizable quick actions for your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Instead of typing \"Please review this code for security vulnerabilities\", you can create `/review/security` and just type that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands vs Skills - Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Slash Commands | Skills |\n",
    "|---------|---------------|--------|\n",
    "| **Activation** | Manual (`/command`) | Automatic (keyword-based) |\n",
    "| **Purpose** | One-off actions, explicit triggers | Domain expertise, context awareness |\n",
    "| **Complexity** | Simple prompt templates | Complex instructions + examples |\n",
    "| **File Format** | `.md` files in `.claude/commands/` | `SKILL.md` in `.claude/skills/dir/` |\n",
    "| **Parameters** | `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder | Context from conversation |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Repeatable tasks, workflows | Automatic assistance, guidance |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Slash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Use slash commands when you:\n",
    "- Need **manual control** over when an action triggers\n",
    "- Have **repeatable prompts** you use frequently\n",
    "- Want **quick access** to specific workflows\n",
    "- Need to pass **parameters** to customize behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- `/test unit` - Run unit tests\n",
    "- `/review/code` - Code review\n",
    "- `/generate/docs MyClass` - Generate documentation\n",
    "- `/refactor/extract-function` - Refactoring assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands live in:\n",
    "- **Project commands**: `.claude/commands/` (shared with team)\n",
    "- **Personal commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` (your machine only)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each command is a simple `.md` file containing the prompt text.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple command for code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Command Anatomy\n",
    "\n",
    "A command file has:\n",
    "1. **Filename**: `command-name.md` in `.claude/commands/`\n",
    "2. **Content**: The prompt text Claude will receive\n",
    "3. **Invocation**: Type `/command-name` in Claude Code\n",

    "1. **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, best practices\n",
    "2. **Bugs**: Potential errors, edge cases, logic issues\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Inefficiencies, optimization opportunities\n",
    "4. **Security**: Common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**: Type `/review` in Claude Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type `/review`:\n",
    "1. Claude Code reads `.claude/commands/review.md`\n",
    "2. The file content becomes your prompt\n",
    "3. Claude responds as if you typed the full prompt\n",

    "\n",
    "### When to Use Slash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use Commands when**:\n",
    "- You want **manual control** over when action triggers\n",
    "- The task is **repeatable** with similar steps\n",
    "- You need to **pass parameters** each time\n",
    "- The prompt is **straightforward** (not complex domain knowledge)\n",
    "- It's a **one-off action** (review, generate, test)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- `/review/security` - You decide when to run security review\n",
    "- `/generate/tests Calculator` - Specify what to test\n",
    "- `/refactor/extract handleSubmit` - Explicit refactoring request\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use Skills when**:\n",
    "- You want **automatic activation** based on context\n",
    "- The task requires **domain expertise** or complex knowledge\n",
    "- You're providing **ongoing guidance** (not one-time action)\n",
    "- The skill needs **examples and patterns** for reference\n",
    "- It should activate when user **mentions keywords**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- `data-science-educator` - Activates when teaching pandas\n",
    "- `notebook-creator` - Activates for notebook creation\n",
    "- `security-expert` - Provides security guidance automatically\n",

    "## 10. Best Practices for Slash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Command Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Names**:\n",
    "- `review` - Clear, concise\n",
    "- `generate/tests` - Namespaced, descriptive\n",
    "- `fix/security` - Action + focus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Names**:\n",
    "- `r` - Too short, unclear\n",
    "- `do-the-thing` - Vague\n",
    "- `generateTestsForMyCode` - Too long, no namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming Rules**:\n",
    "1. Use lowercase with hyphens: `review-code` not `ReviewCode`\n",
    "2. Start with action verb: `generate`, `review`, `fix`, `analyze`\n",
    "3. Use namespaces for related commands: `review/security`\n",
    "4. Keep names under 20 characters\n",
    "5. Be descriptive but concise\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Writing Effective Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Prompt Structure**:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Please [ACTION] for $ARGUMENTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 1**: Specific requirement\n",
    "**Section 2**: Another requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "Output format: [Specify format]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Please generate unit tests for $ARGUMENTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coverage**: Test happy path, edge cases, and errors\n",
    "**Style**: Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern\n",
    "**Framework**: Auto-detect (pytest, jest, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Complete test file with imports\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Using $ARGUMENTS Effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do**:\n",
    "- Use `$ARGUMENTS` when you need different input each time\n",
    "- Place it where the dynamic content should go\n",
    "- Use it multiple times if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't**:\n",
    "- Use `$ARGUMENTS` if the command never needs parameters\n",
    "- Expect structured data (it's just a string)\n",
    "- Rely on users typing it in a specific format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - Multiple uses**:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Refactor $ARGUMENTS to improve readability.\n",
    "After refactoring $ARGUMENTS, explain the changes made.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Organizing Command Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Structure**:\n",
    "```\n",

    "└── fix/             # Bug fixing\n",

    "- Easy to find related commands\n",
    "- Clear purpose from directory name\n",
    "- Scalable as library grows\n",
    "- Team members can navigate easily\n",
    "\n",
