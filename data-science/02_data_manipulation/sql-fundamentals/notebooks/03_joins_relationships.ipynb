    "In this module, you learned:\n",
    "- ✓ Understanding table relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)\n",
    "- ✓ Using INNER JOIN to combine matching rows\n",
    "- ✓ Using LEFT JOIN to include all left table rows\n",
    "- ✓ Performing multi-table JOINs\n",
    "- ✓ Using self-joins for hierarchical data\n",
    "- ✓ Combining different JOIN types in one query\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows from both tables\n",
    "- LEFT JOIN: All rows from left table + matches from right\n",
    "- Use table aliases for clarity (e.g., customers c)\n",
    "- JOIN order matters for readability and performance\n",
    "- Self-joins use the same table twice with different aliases\n",
