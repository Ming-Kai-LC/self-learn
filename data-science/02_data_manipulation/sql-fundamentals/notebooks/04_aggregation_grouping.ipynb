    "\n",
    "In this module, you learned:\n",
    "- ✓ Using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)\n",
    "- ✓ Grouping data with GROUP BY\n",
    "- ✓ Grouping by multiple columns\n",
    "- ✓ Filtering grouped data with HAVING\n",
    "- ✓ Difference between WHERE and HAVING\n",
    "- ✓ Combining GROUP BY with JOINs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Aggregate functions collapse multiple rows into a single result\n",
    "- GROUP BY creates groups of rows for aggregation\n",
    "- WHERE filters rows before grouping\n",
    "- HAVING filters groups after aggregation\n",
    "- Use COUNT(DISTINCT column) to count unique values\n",
    "- Combine aggregation with JOINs for powerful reports\n",
