    "\n",
    "In this module, you learned:\n",
    "- ✓ Writing subqueries in WHERE, FROM, and SELECT clauses\n",
    "- ✓ Understanding correlated vs non-correlated subqueries\n",
    "- ✓ Using EXISTS and NOT EXISTS for efficient filtering\n",
    "- ✓ Creating CTEs with WITH clause for readable queries\n",
    "- ✓ Using multiple CTEs in complex analyses\n",
    "- ✓ When to use subqueries vs JOINs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Subqueries can appear in WHERE, FROM, and SELECT clauses\n",
    "- EXISTS is more efficient than IN for large datasets\n",
    "- CTEs make complex queries more readable and maintainable\n",
    "- Multiple CTEs can break down complex logic into steps\n",
    "- Use subqueries when you need to compare against aggregates\n",
    "- CTEs are evaluated once and reusable in the main query\n",
