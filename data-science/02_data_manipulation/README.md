# Data Manipulation

Core data handling skills using SQL, Pandas, and NumPy.

## Overview

Data manipulation is the foundation of data science work. According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"SQL proficiency is non-negotiable—69-79% of data science jobs require it, making it the second most in-demand technical skill after Python."**

This domain teaches you to load, clean, transform, and analyze data efficiently using industry-standard tools.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **sql-fundamentals** (~12 hours)
   - SQL for data science
   - Joins, aggregations, window functions
   - Database design basics
   - Practice on HackerRank and LeetCode

2. **data-science-fundamentals** (12-13 hours)
   - NumPy for numerical computing
   - Pandas for data manipulation
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. sql-fundamentals (essential for any data role)
2. data-science-fundamentals (Python data stack)

**Time investment:** 2-3 months combining both

## Prerequisites

- **python-fundamentals** (Python basics)
- **mathematics-for-data-science** (statistics helps but not strictly required)

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Write complex SQL queries confidently
- Manipulate data fluently with Pandas
- Perform numerical computing with NumPy
- Clean messy real-world data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Merge and reshape datasets

## Key Skills

- **SQL**: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, window functions, CTEs, subqueries
- **Pandas**: DataFrame operations, groupby, merge, pivot, apply
- **NumPy**: Arrays, broadcasting, vectorization, linear algebra operations

## Next Steps

Proceed to:
- **03_visualization** - Visualize your data insights
- **04_data_engineering** - Build data pipelines
- **05_machine_learning** - Apply ML to your data

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)
- Master Pandas through "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney
- Practice SQL intensively: 100+ problems on HackerRank
- Allocate 6-8 weeks for NumPy and Pandas proficiency
- Budget 2-3 months for SQL mastery
