# Machine Learning

Core machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera is the universally recommended starting point"** combined with practical implementation using scikit-learn.

This domain covers supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and ensemble methods - the core skills for 77% of AI-related jobs.

- **Months 10-12**: Ensemble methods (Kaggle competition winners)

## Industry Relevance

- **77%** of AI jobs require traditional ML (not just deep learning)
- XGBoost/LightGBM dominate tabular data competitions
- Feature engineering separates junior from senior data scientists
- Required skills for data scientist roles at all levels
