# Computer Vision

Image processing and computer vision applications.

## Overview

Computer vision combines traditional image processing with deep learning to enable machines to understand visual data. This domain covers foundational image processing techniques and modern deep learning approaches for vision tasks.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **image-processing** (~10 hours)
   - OpenCV fundamentals
   - Image manipulation and transformations
   - Filtering and edge detection
   - Feature extraction
   - Traditional CV techniques

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. image-processing (traditional CV and OpenCV)
2. **cnn-learning** from 06_deep_learning (deep learning for CV)
