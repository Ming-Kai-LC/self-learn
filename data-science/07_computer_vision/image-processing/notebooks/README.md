# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks for the Image Processing learning series.

## Notebooks

### Completed Notebooks
1. **00_setup_and_introduction.ipynb** - Setup guide and introduction for complete beginners
2. **01_getting_started_opencv.ipynb** - Getting started with OpenCV basics

### Future Notebooks (Coming Soon)
3. 02_image_basics_roi.ipynb - Image basics and Region of Interest
4. 03_image_processing_fundamentals.ipynb - Thresholding, filtering, OCR
5. 04_image_transformations.ipynb - Geometric transformations
6. 05_morphological_operations.ipynb - Morphological operations
7. 06_image_segmentation.ipynb - Image segmentation techniques
8. 07_feature_detection.ipynb - Feature detection (SIFT, ORB, etc.)
9. 08_feature_matching.ipynb - Feature matching applications
10. 09_hand_gesture_recognition.ipynb - Bonus: Hand gesture recognition

## Outputs Directory

The `outputs/` subdirectory contains files generated by running the notebooks:

- **notebook_00/** - Generated files from notebook 00 (currently none)
- **notebook_01/** - Generated files from notebook 01:
  - `sample_image.jpg` - Test gradient image
  - `saved_image.jpg` - Copy of sample image
  - `sample_video.mp4` - 3-second animated video
  - `my_house.jpg` - House drawing example

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Open notebooks in order (00, 01, 02, etc.)
4. Run cells sequentially from top to bottom
5. Generated files will be saved in `outputs/notebook_XX/`

## Notes

- Notebooks should be run in order for best learning experience
- Each notebook builds on concepts from previous ones
- All outputs are automatically organized by notebook number
- Feel free to modify and experiment with the code!
