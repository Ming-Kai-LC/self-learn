    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Image Processing with OpenCV learning series! This comprehensive guide will take you from absolute beginner to proficient in image processing using Python and OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Image Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Processing** is a method to perform operations on digital images to:\n",
    "- Enhance image quality\n",
    "- Extract useful information\n",
    "- Recognize objects and patterns\n",
    "- Create visual effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OpenCV?\n",
    "\n",
    "**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is:\n",
    "- A powerful, open-source computer vision and machine learning library\n",
    "- Started at Intel in 1999 by Gary Bradsky\n",
    "- Supports multiple programming languages (Python, C++, Java)\n",
    "- Used in applications like:\n",
    "  - Facial recognition\n",
    "  - Self-driving cars\n",
    "  - Medical image analysis\n",
    "  - Augmented reality\n",
    "  - Photo editing apps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python for Image Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python + OpenCV is an excellent combination because:\n",
    "- **Easy to learn**: Python has simple, readable syntax\n",
    "- **Powerful**: OpenCV provides advanced image processing capabilities\n",
    "- **Numpy integration**: Fast numerical operations\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: Easy visualization of results\n",
    "- **Large community**: Lots of tutorials and support\n",
