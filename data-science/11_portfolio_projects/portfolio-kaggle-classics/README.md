# Portfolio Projects - Kaggle Classics

**Status**: 🚧 Placeholder - Content to be developed
**Difficulty**: ⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐ (Progressive)
**Estimated Time**: 150-200 hours (all projects)
**Roadmap Alignment**: Foundation to Advanced (Months 4-18)

## Overview

This project contains classic Kaggle competitions and portfolio projects mentioned in the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md. According to the roadmap: **"Portfolio projects demonstrate capability far more effectively than certificates—employers prioritize demonstrated skills over credentials."**

The goal is to build **10-15 projects across difficulty levels**, each showcasing different skills and increasingly complex capabilities.
