# Portfolio Projects

Real-world projects demonstrating data science capabilities.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Portfolio projects demonstrate capability far more effectively than certificates—employers prioritize demonstrated skills over credentials."**

The goal is to build **10-15 projects across difficulty levels**, each showcasing different skills and increasingly complex capabilities.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **portfolio-kaggle-classics** (150-200 hours total) 🚧 *Placeholder*
   - **Beginner** (5 projects): Titanic, House Prices, Iris, Customer Churn, 911 Calls
   - **Intermediate** (5 projects): Sentiment Analysis, Recommendation System, Time Series, Customer Segmentation, Fraud Detection
   - **Advanced** (3-5 projects): Production ML System, Kaggle Competition, Open-Source Contribution, Original Research

## Portfolio Strategy

**Time Investment by Level**:
- **Beginner projects**: 20-40 hours each
- **Intermediate projects**: 40-80 hours each
- **Advanced projects**: 80+ hours each

**Quality over Quantity**:
- Better to have 5 excellent projects than 20 mediocre ones
- Each project should demonstrate specific skills
- Professional documentation is mandatory
- Deploy at least 2-3 projects as web apps

## GitHub Repository Standards

Use **Cookiecutter Data Science** template:
- Consistent folder structure
- Professional README with problem, approach, results
- Requirements.txt for reproducibility
- Clean code with proper documentation
- .gitignore for data and credentials

## What Makes a Great Portfolio Project

✅ **Include**:
- Clear problem statement and motivation
- Thorough EDA with visualizations
- Multiple modeling approaches compared
- Feature engineering explanations
- Model evaluation with appropriate metrics
- Key insights and business recommendations
- Instructions to reproduce results
- Deployed application (for intermediate/advanced)

❌ **Avoid**:
- Tutorial code without modification
- Datasets without understanding
- Missing documentation
- Unclear problem statements
- No deployment or real-world application
- Poor code quality

## Prerequisites

- **machine-learning-fundamentals** (for ML projects)
- **deep-learning-fundamentals** (for DL projects)
- **feature-engineering** (to improve models)
- **data-visualization-fundamentals** (for compelling presentations)
- **mlops-deployment** (for advanced projects)

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Build 10-15 substantial portfolio projects
- Demonstrate diverse technical skills
- Create deployable applications
- Win Kaggle medals (Bronze or Silver)
- Contribute to open-source
- Have interview-ready project presentations
- Stand out to employers

## Project Categories

**Classification**: Customer churn, sentiment analysis, fraud detection
**Regression**: House prices, sales forecasting
**Clustering**: Customer segmentation, pattern discovery
**NLP**: Sentiment analysis, text classification, chatbots
**Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection
**Time Series**: Sales forecasting, stock prediction
**Recommendation**: Movie/product recommendations
**Production**: Full ML pipeline with deployment

## Kaggle Strategy

- Complete **Kaggle Learn** micro-courses (~45 hours)
- Start with "Getting Started" competitions
- Study top-performing notebooks
- Aim for **Contributor → Expert** progression
- Target Bronze (top 40%) or Silver (top 20%) medals

## Next Steps

After building your portfolio:
1. Polish GitHub profile - pin best projects
2. Write technical blog posts
3. Update resume with project metrics
4. Prepare project presentations for interviews
5. Apply to jobs (50+ positions)
6. Continue building - 1-2 new projects per quarter

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Throughout learning journey (Months 4-18)
- **Months 4-6**: 3-4 beginner projects
- **Months 6-12**: 4-5 intermediate projects
- **Months 12-18**: 2-3 advanced projects
- **Ongoing**: Kaggle and open-source

## Success Criteria

Portfolio is complete when:
- ✅ 10-15 substantial projects across all difficulty levels
- ✅ Clean, professional GitHub repositories
- ✅ At least 2-3 deployed applications
- ✅ 1+ Kaggle medal (Bronze minimum)
- ✅ Diverse problem types covered
- ✅ Production skills demonstrated

## Interview Preparation

Each project should have:
- **Elevator pitch**: 30-second project summary
- **Technical deep-dive**: Architecture, algorithms, trade-offs
- **Results and impact**: Metrics, business value
- **Challenges and learnings**: What went wrong, how you solved it
- **Future improvements**: What you'd do differently
