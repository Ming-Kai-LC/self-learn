    "## Part 1: What Are Candlestick Charts?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📜 A Brief History\n",
    "\n",
    "Candlestick charts were invented by **Munehisa Homma**, a Japanese rice trader in the 1700s. Over 300 years later, they're still the most popular way to visualize stock prices!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Because they show WAY more information than simple line charts in a single glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Use Candlesticks Instead of Line Charts?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line Chart:**\n",
    "- Shows only closing prices\n",
    "- Misses important intraday information\n",
    "- Can't show battle between buyers and sellers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Candlestick Chart:**\n",
    "- Shows Open, High, Low, AND Close\n",
    "- Reveals the \"story\" of each trading day\n",
    "- Shows who won: buyers or sellers\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way:\n",
    "- **Line chart** = Seeing only the final score of a football match\n",
    "- **Candlestick** = Watching the entire game, seeing all the action!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Anatomy of a Candlestick\n",
    "\n",
    "Each candlestick represents **one trading period** (could be a day, hour, week, etc.) and has three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **The Body** (Rectangle)\n",
    "- The thick rectangular part\n",
    "- Shows the range between **Open** and **Close**\n",
    "- **Color matters:**\n",
    "  - **Green/White body**: Close > Open (Price went UP 📈 - Bullish!)\n",
    "  - **Red/Black body**: Close < Open (Price went DOWN 📉 - Bearish!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Upper Shadow / Upper Wick** (Line above body)\n",
    "- The thin line extending above the body\n",
    "- Shows how high the price went during the day\n",
    "- Represents the **High** price\n",
    "- *What it tells us:* Buyers pushed price up, but couldn't hold it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Lower Shadow / Lower Wick** (Line below body)\n",
    "- The thin line extending below the body\n",
    "- Shows how low the price went during the day\n",
    "- Represents the **Low** price\n",
    "- *What it tells us:* Sellers pushed price down, but buyers fought back\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟢 Example 1: Bullish (Green) Candle\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Story:** Buyers won the battle!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   High: RM 1.30 ──┐\n",
    "                   │ ← Upper Shadow\n",
    "   Close: RM 1.25 ─┬─┐\n",
    "                   │ │\n",
    "                   │ │ ← Body (Green/White)\n",
    "                   │ │    Buyers in control!\n",
    "   Open: RM 1.20 ──└─┘\n",
    "                   │ ← Lower Shadow  \n",
    "   Low: RM 1.18 ───┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happened:**\n",
    "1. **Market opened** at RM 1.20\n",
    "2. Sellers pushed it down to RM 1.18 (Low)\n",
    "3. Buyers fought back and pushed it up to RM 1.30 (High)\n",
    "4. Some profit-taking brought it back down\n",
    "5. **Market closed** at RM 1.25\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Price closed HIGHER than it opened → Bullish day! 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 Example 2: Bearish (Red) Candle\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Story:** Sellers won the battle!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   High: RM 1.30 ──┐\n",
    "                   │ ← Upper Shadow\n",
    "   Open: RM 1.25 ──┬─┐\n",

    "                   │ │    Sellers in control!\n",
    "   Close: RM 1.20 ─└─┘\n",
    "                   │ ← Lower Shadow\n",
    "   Low: RM 1.18 ───┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happened:**\n",
    "1. **Market opened** at RM 1.25\n",
    "2. Buyers tried to push it up to RM 1.30 (High)\n",
    "3. Sellers overpowered them and pushed it down\n",
    "4. Price dropped all the way to RM 1.18 (Low)\n",
    "5. **Market closed** at RM 1.20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Price closed LOWER than it opened → Bearish day! 📉\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Reading the Shadows (Wicks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Upper Shadow:**\n",
    "- Buyers pushed price high but couldn't hold it\n",
    "- Sellers are strong\n",
    "- *Often bearish signal*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Lower Shadow:**\n",
    "- Sellers pushed price low but buyers fought back\n",
    "- Buyers are strong\n",
    "- *Often bullish signal*\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Shadows (Marubozu):**\n",
    "- Strong conviction in one direction\n",
    "- Price opened at one extreme and closed at the other\n",
    "- Very powerful signal!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Think About It\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, look at this candlestick and answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   High: RM 2.00 ──┐\n",
    "                   │ Long Upper Shadow\n",
    "   Open: RM 1.50 ──┬─┐\n",
    "   Close: RM 1.48 ─└─┘ Small body\n",
    "   Low: RM 1.45 ───┘\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. Is this bullish or bearish?\n",
    "2. Who tried to win but failed?\n",
    "3. What does the long upper shadow tell you?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers:**\n",
    "1. Bearish (red candle - closed lower than opened)\n",
    "2. Buyers tried to push it to RM 2.00 but failed miserably\n",
    "3. Strong selling pressure - every time buyers pushed up, sellers pushed it back down. This is a bearish signal!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "**One candlestick = The entire battle between buyers and sellers for that day**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Body size** = Strength of the move\n",
    "- **Body color** = Who won (green = buyers, red = sellers)\n",
    "- **Shadows** = Failed attempts and rejection\n",

    "## Part 3: Support and Resistance Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support and Resistance** are THE MOST important concepts in technical analysis. Master these, and you'll already be ahead of most beginners!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What Are These Levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of stock prices like a bouncing ball in a room:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Level** = The FLOOR\n",
    "- A price level where the stock tends to **find buying interest**\n",
    "- Price has difficulty falling below this level\n",
    "- When price approaches support, **buyers step in** to catch the falling price\n",
    "- Like a trampoline - price bounces back UP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resistance Level** = The CEILING\n",
    "- A price level where the stock tends to **find selling pressure**\n",
    "- Price has difficulty rising above this level  \n",
    "- When price approaches resistance, **sellers step in** to take profits\n",
    "- Like hitting your head on the ceiling - price bounces back DOWN\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine UUE stock:\n",
    "- Has been bouncing between RM 0.50 and RM 0.60 for months\n",
    "- Every time it drops to RM 0.50, buyers say \"Great price!\" and buy\n",
    "- Every time it rises to RM 0.60, sellers say \"Time to sell!\" and take profits\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "- **RM 0.50 = Support** (floor - price bounces UP from here)\n",
    "- **RM 0.60 = Resistance** (ceiling - price bounces DOWN from here)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 The Psychology Behind It\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do Support and Resistance exist?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**At Support (RM 0.50):**\n",
    "- Previous buyers who bought at RM 0.50: \"This is a good price, let me buy more!\"\n",
    "- Previous sellers who sold at RM 0.50: \"I regret selling, let me buy back!\"\n",
    "- New buyers: \"Everyone seems to buy at RM 0.50, I should too!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**At Resistance (RM 0.60):**\n",
    "- Previous buyers at RM 0.50: \"20% profit! Time to sell!\"\n",
    "- Previous buyers at RM 0.60 who are stuck: \"Finally breaking even, let me sell!\"\n",
    "- Traders: \"It always falls from RM 0.60, let me sell before it drops!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's all about **human psychology and memory**!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 Why They Matter (EXTREMELY Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Trading Decisions**\n",
    "- **Buy near support** → Low risk, high reward (floor is nearby)\n",
    "- **Sell near resistance** → Take profits before price falls\n",
    "- **Avoid buying near resistance** → High risk (ceiling nearby)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Breakouts = Big Moves**\n",
    "- When price **breaks ABOVE resistance** → 🚀 Often shoots much higher!  \n",
    "  - *Why?* All the sellers who were waiting are done, only buyers left\n",
    "  \n",
    "- When price **breaks BELOW support** → 📉 Often drops much further!\n",
    "  - *Why?* All the buyers who were waiting give up, panic selling begins\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Risk Management**  \n",
    "- **Set stop-losses below support** → If support breaks, you exit with small loss\n",
    "- **Set profit targets at resistance** → Lock in gains before price reverses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Role Reversal (Mind-Blowing Concept!)**\n",
    "- **Old resistance becomes NEW support** when broken upward\n",
    "  - *Example*: Stock breaks above RM 0.60 resistance, then RM 0.60 becomes the new floor!\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Old support becomes NEW resistance** when broken downward\n",
    "  - *Example*: Stock breaks below RM 0.50 support, then RM 0.50 becomes the new ceiling!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Think About It\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Current Price: RM 0.55\n",
    "Support: RM 0.50 (bounced here 3 times in past 2 months)\n",
    "Resistance: RM 0.60 (rejected here 3 times in past 2 months)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1:** If you buy at RM 0.55, where would you place your stop-loss?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Just below RM 0.50 (maybe RM 0.49) - if support breaks, you're wrong, exit!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:** If you buy at RM 0.55, where's your first profit target?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Just below RM 0.60 (maybe RM 0.59) - take profits before hitting resistance!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:** If price breaks ABOVE RM 0.60 with high volume, what should you do?\n",
    "- **Answer:** This is a bullish breakout! Price might go much higher. Consider buying or holding!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 How to Identify Support and Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for **price levels where**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Bounces** → Price touched it 2-3+ times\n",
    "2. **Strong Reactions** → Price bounced sharply (not slowly)\n",
    "3. **Round Numbers** → Humans like RM 0.50, RM 1.00, RM 5.00 (psychological levels)\n",
    "4. **Recent Highs/Lows** → Markets have memory, recent extremes matter\n",
    "5. **High Volume** → Many participants = stronger level\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support and Resistance are ZONES, not exact prices!**\n",
    "- Don't expect support to be exactly RM 0.500000\n",
    "- Think of it as RM 0.48 - 0.52 (a zone around RM 0.50)\n",
    "- Give some wiggle room!\n",
    "\n",
    "**They're not magic - they CAN break!**\n",
    "- When they break, they often break HARD\n",
    "- Always use stop-losses to protect yourself\n",
    "- Never assume \"it will definitely bounce here\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The more times a level is tested, the WEAKER it becomes**\n",
    "- Like tapping on glass repeatedly - eventually it breaks\n",
    "- If price tests resistance 5 times, the 6th time it might break through!\n",

    "```\n",
    "   High ──┐\n",
    "          │ ← Upper shadow\n",
    "   O/C ──┼── ← Very small body (Open ≈ Close)\n",
    "          │ ← Lower shadow\n",
    "   Low ──┘\n",

    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Open ≈ Close (body is tiny or non-existent)\n",
    "- Can have long or short shadows\n",
    "- Looks like a cross or plus sign (+)\n",

    "- **Indecision**: Neither buyers nor sellers won\n",
    "- Market opened, battle ensued all day, ended at same price\n",
    "- Like a tug-of-war ending in a tie\n",

    "**When it matters:**\n",
    "- **In an uptrend** → Warning! Buyers losing steam, possible reversal down\n",
    "- **In a downtrend** → Warning! Sellers losing steam, possible reversal up\n",
    "- **In sideways market** → Just more sideways movement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world example:**\n",
    "- Stock in strong uptrend for weeks\n",
    "- Suddenly a Doji appears\n",
    "- Next few days: Price starts falling (trend reversal!)\n",

    "          │\n",
    "   Low ──┘\n",

    "- Long lower shadow (at least 2x body length)\n",
    "- Little to no upper shadow\n",
    "- Looks like a hammer 🔨\n",

    "- **Buyers fought back strongly** and pushed price back up\n",
    "- Buyers won the battle! 💪\n",

    "- Signals: \"The selling is over, buyers are stepping in!\"\n",
    "- Often marks the bottom before price goes up\n",

    "**Trading strategy:**\n",
    "- Wait for next candle to CONFIRM (should be green/bullish)\n",
    "- Buy when confirmation appears\n",
    "- Set stop-loss below the hammer's low\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say you're analyzing UUE stock:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Check Weekly Chart (The Boss)**\n",
    "- Trend: Strong uptrend for past 3 months\n",
    "- **Decision**: Only look for BUY opportunities (trend is up)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Check Daily Chart (The Manager)**\n",
    "- Current: Stock pulled back to RM 0.50 support\n",
    "- Pattern: Hammer appeared yesterday\n",
    "- **Decision**: This looks like a good entry zone!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Check 1-Hour Chart (The Worker)**\n",
    "- Current: Price bouncing off RM 0.50\n",
    "- Entry: Wait for green candle above RM 0.51\n",
    "- **Decision**: Buy at RM 0.51 with stop at RM 0.49\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Rule #1: Trade in the Direction of the Higher Time Frame**\n",

    "- Weekly chart shows downtrend → Only SELL on daily chart\n",
    "- **Never fight the higher time frame trend!**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rule #2: Higher Time Frames are More Reliable**\n",
    "- Daily chart > 1-hour chart > 15-minute chart\n",
    "- The longer the time frame, the stronger the signal\n",
    "- Short time frames lie often, long time frames rarely do\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Rule #3: Use Lower Time Frames for Entry, Not Direction**\n",
    "- Don't decide \"buy or sell\" based on 5-minute chart\n",
    "- Use daily/weekly for direction\n",
    "- Use 5-min/15-min for precise entry timing\n",

    "### 🤔 Think About It\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** You see these signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weekly Chart**: Strong downtrend\n",
    "- **Daily Chart**: Hammer pattern at support\n",
    "- **Should you buy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** NO! \n",
    "- The weekly \"boss\" says downtrend\n",
    "- The daily hammer is a trap (false signal)\n",
    "- This is called a \"counter-trend trade\" - very risky!\n",
    "- **Wait for weekly trend to change first**\n",

    "### 💡 Time Frame Selection Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to choose YOUR time frame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How much time can you dedicate?**\n",
    "   - Less than 1 hour/day → Daily charts or higher\n",
    "   - 2-3 hours/day → 1-hour or daily charts\n",
    "   - Full day → Any time frame\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How patient are you?**\n",
    "   - Very patient → Weekly/Monthly\n",
    "   - Moderately patient → Daily\n",
    "   - Impatient → Hour/15-min (but be careful!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How stressful can you handle?**\n",
    "   - Low stress → Daily or higher\n",
    "   - Medium stress → 4-hour/1-hour\n",
    "   - High stress → Minute charts (not recommended!)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How much capital do you have?**\n",
    "   - Small ($1,000 - $10,000) → Longer time frames (fewer trades = lower costs)\n",
    "   - Large ($50,000+) → Any time frame\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 For beginners: Start with DAILY charts. They're the perfect balance!**\n",

    "#### 2. **Support and Resistance** (THE Most Important Concept!)\n",
    "   - **Support = Floor**: Price level where buyers step in\n",
    "   - **Resistance = Ceiling**: Price level where sellers step in\n",
    "   - **Psychology**: Why these levels exist (human memory and behavior)\n",

    "#### 3. **Candlestick Patterns**\n",
    "   - **Doji**: Indecision - trend might change\n",
    "   - **Hammer**: Bullish reversal (must appear at support!)\n",
    "   - **Shooting Star**: Bearish reversal (must appear at resistance!)\n",

    "#### **3. Context is EVERYTHING**\n",
    "- Hammer at support after downtrend = Powerful ✅\n",
    "- Hammer at resistance = Meaningless ❌\n",
    "- **Action**: Always check WHERE patterns appear!\n",
    "\n",

    "- Don't trade on pattern candle itself\n",
    "- Wait for next candle to confirm\n",
    "- Volume validates the signal\n",
    "- **Action**: Be patient, wait for confirmation!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Higher Time Frames Rule**\n",

    "\n",
    "Test yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1:** You see a green Marubozu after weeks of consolidation. What does it signal?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Strong bullish conviction! Likely start of uptrend. Consider buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:** Stock is at resistance. Shooting star appears. Next candle is red. What to do?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Bearish reversal confirmed! Sell or tighten stop-losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:** Weekly shows downtrend, daily shows hammer at support. Buy or wait?\n",
    "- **Answer:** WAIT! Weekly boss says down. Daily hammer is a trap (counter-trend).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4:** Where should you set stop-loss if buying near support at RM 0.50?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Just below support, around RM 0.48-0.49. If support breaks, you're wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5:** You see price bouncing off RM 1.00 three times. What is RM 1.00?\n",
    "- **Answer:** Strong resistance level. Multiple rejections = strong selling pressure.\n",

    "### 1. **Buying at Resistance** ❌\n",
    "- **Mistake**: \"Stock looks good, I'll buy now!\" (at RM 0.60 resistance)\n",
    "- **Result**: Price immediately drops to RM 0.55\n",
    "- **✅ Correct**: Wait for breakout above resistance OR buy near support\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Ignoring Higher Time Frames** ❌\n",
    "- **Mistake**: \"15-minute chart shows hammer, I'll buy!\"\n",
    "- **Reality**: Weekly chart shows strong downtrend\n",
    "- **Result**: Small bounce then continued fall\n",
    "- **✅ Correct**: Check weekly FIRST, then daily, then hourly\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Trading Without Confirmation** ❌\n",
    "- **Mistake**: Buying on the pattern candle itself\n",
    "- **Example**: See hammer, buy immediately\n",
    "- **Result**: Next candle is red, pattern fails\n",
    "- **✅ Correct**: Wait for next green candle to confirm\n",

    "### 4. **No Stop-Loss** ❌\n",
    "- **Mistake**: \"I'll just hold if it goes down, it will come back\"\n",
    "- **Reality**: Stock continues falling, -50% loss\n",
    "- **✅ Correct**: ALWAYS set stop-loss below support before buying\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Forcing Trades** ❌\n",
    "- **Mistake**: \"I must trade today!\" (when there's no clear setup)\n",
    "- **Result**: Enter at bad prices, lose money\n",
    "- **✅ Correct**: Wait for proper setups. Sometimes cash is a position!\n",

    "- **Mistake**: Stock breaks resistance, buy at the peak\n",
    "- **Result**: False breakout, price falls back down\n",

    "## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Charts Not Displaying\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Causes:**\n",
    "1. Plotly not installed properly\n",
    "2. Notebook not in interactive mode\n",
    "3. Data wasn't fetched successfully\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Try this in a new cell:\n",
    "!pip install plotly --upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then restart kernel and re-run all cells\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: \"No Data Returned\" Error\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Ticker might be wrong or delisted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **Check ticker format**: Must be \"0310.KL\" not \"0310\" or \"UUE\"\n",
    "2. **Try alternative stocks**: 1155.KL, 1295.KL, 5296.KL\n",
    "3. **Check internet connection**\n",
    "4. **Verify on Yahoo Finance**: Visit finance.yahoo.com and search for stock\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Pattern Detection Shows Zero Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is actually NORMAL!** It means:\n",
    "- Strong trending market (no reversals)\n",
    "- Patterns exist but don't meet our thresholds\n",
    "- Time period too short\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "- Try longer time period: `period=\"6mo\"` or `period=\"1y\"`\n",
    "- Adjust thresholds in pattern detection code (make them less strict)\n",
    "- Manually look at charts - automated detection isn't perfect\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Support/Resistance Levels Seem Wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "- These are AUTOMATED calculations (simplified)\n",
    "- Real S/R identification requires visual inspection\n",
    "- Our code finds extremes, not necessarily best levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "- Use the interactive chart to visually identify levels\n",
    "- Look for MULTIPLE bounces at same price\n",
    "- Round numbers (RM 0.50, 1.00) are often better than calculated levels\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Can't Decide if Pattern is Valid\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checklist:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Does it match the pattern definition? (body/shadow ratios)\n",
    "2. ✅ Is it at support (Hammer) or resistance (Shooting Star)?\n",
    "3. ✅ Was there confirmation next candle?\n",
    "4. ✅ Was volume above average?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If any answer is NO, skip the trade!**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Time Frames Show Conflicting Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is NORMAL during trend transitions!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "1. **Follow the highest time frame** (weekly > daily > hourly)\n",
    "2. **Wait for alignment** - don't force trades\n",
    "3. **If weekly says UP but daily says DOWN**:\n",
    "   - Healthy pullback in uptrend\n",
    "   - Wait for daily to turn back up\n",
    "   - Then buy at support\n",
