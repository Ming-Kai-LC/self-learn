    "# 📊 Notebook 03: Trend Analysis with Moving Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 03! You're about to learn one of the most powerful and widely-used tools in technical analysis. Moving Averages are beloved by both beginner and professional traders worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand Moving Averages (MA)** - What they are and why traders love them\n",
    "2. **Calculate SMA and EMA** - Two different types with different strengths\n",
    "3. **Use Common MA Periods** - The magic numbers: 20, 50, and 200\n",
    "4. **Identify Trends** - Is the stock going up, down, or sideways?\n",
    "5. **Spot Golden Cross & Death Cross** - Powerful signals that move markets\n",
    "6. **Generate Trading Signals** - When to buy and when to sell using MA crossovers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Completed Notebooks 01-02**\n",
    "- You understand OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)\n",
    "- You can read candlestick charts\n",
    "- You know what support and resistance mean\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Basic Concepts Ready**\n",
    "- You understand what a trend is\n",
    "- You've seen price charts before\n",
    "- You're comfortable with basic Python and pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Mental Preparation**\n",
    "- 60-75 minutes of focused learning time\n",
    "- Notebook and pen for taking notes (highly recommended!)\n",
    "- Curious mindset - ask \"why?\" as you learn\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ Time Required\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-75 minutes** (don't rush - understanding is more important than speed!)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Traffic Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to understand traffic patterns on a busy highway:\n",
    "- **Individual cars** = Daily stock prices (noisy, unpredictable)\n",
    "- **Average traffic flow** = Moving Average (smooth, shows the trend)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how you'd watch the average flow of traffic to understand if rush hour is starting or ending, traders use Moving Averages to understand if a stock is trending up, down, or sideways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Averages are:\n",
    "- **Used by institutional traders** - Banks and hedge funds watch these closely\n",
    "- **Market-moving indicators** - When a stock crosses its 200-day MA, it often makes news\n",
    "- **Self-fulfilling prophecies** - Because so many traders use them, they actually influence price movement\n",
    "- **Simple yet powerful** - One of the best tools for beginners to learn first\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes MAs Special?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **They smooth out the noise** - Price jumps around daily, MAs show the true direction\n",
    "✅ **They act as support and resistance** - Stocks often bounce off their MAs\n",
    "✅ **They generate clear signals** - MA crossovers give specific buy/sell points\n",
    "✅ **They work across timeframes** - Use them for day trading or long-term investing\n",
    "✅ **They're universally understood** - Ask any trader about MAs and they'll know exactly what you mean\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 What to Expect in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1**: Setup - Import libraries and fetch UUE Holdings data\n",
    "**Part 2**: Simple Moving Average (SMA) - Equal weight to all prices\n",
    "**Part 3**: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) - More weight to recent prices\n",
    "**Part 4**: Golden Cross & Death Cross - The most famous MA patterns\n",
    "**Part 5**: MA Crossover Strategy - A complete trading system\n",
    "**Part 6**: Practice & Takeaways - Solidify your learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's begin! 🚀**\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🤔 What is a Simple Moving Average?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** is the average price over a specific number of days, where each day gets equal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Classroom Grade Analogy 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine calculating your average test score:\n",
    "- You got: 80, 85, 90, 85, 95 (5 tests)\n",
    "- **Average = (80 + 85 + 90 + 85 + 95) ÷ 5 = 87**\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly how SMA works! It takes the last N closing prices and calculates their average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why \"Moving\" Average?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called \"moving\" because:\n",
    "- Every day, we drop the oldest price and add the newest price\n",
    "- The average \"moves forward\" with time\n",
    "- It's like a rolling window that slides along with the stock price\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with 3-day SMA**:\n",
    "- Day 1-3: Average of [RM 1.00, RM 1.10, RM 1.20] = RM 1.10\n",
    "- Day 2-4: Average of [RM 1.10, RM 1.20, RM 1.15] = RM 1.15 (dropped day 1, added day 4)\n",

    "# Part 3: Exponential Moving Average (EMA)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 What is an Exponential Moving Average?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The News Headline Analogy 📰\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how you remember news:\n",
    "- **SMA approach**: Yesterday's news = Last week's news = Last month's news (all equally important)\n",
    "- **EMA approach**: Yesterday's news is more important than last week's, which is more important than last month's\n",
    "\n",
    "**EMA says**: \"Recent events matter more than old events!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use EMA?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Faster reaction** - Catches trend changes earlier than SMA\n",
    "✅ **Less lag** - Doesn't drag behind price as much\n",
    "✅ **Better for active trading** - Gives quicker signals\n",
    "✅ **Reduces whipsaw** - In trending markets, it confirms trends faster\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Trade-off**: More sensitive = more false signals in choppy markets\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 How EMA Works (The Math Made Simple)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry, you don't need to memorize this - just understand the concept!\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMA Formula (Equal Weight)\n",
    "```\n",
    "SMA = (P1 + P2 + P3 + ... + P20) ÷ 20\n",
    "Each price gets 1/20 = 5% weight\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### EMA Formula (More Weight to Recent)\n",
    "```\n",
    "EMA = (Current Price × Multiplier) + (Previous EMA × (1 - Multiplier))\n",
    "Where Multiplier = 2 ÷ (Period + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For 20-period EMA:\n",
    "Multiplier = 2 ÷ 21 = 0.095 (9.5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's price gets 9.5% weight\n",
    "Yesterday's EMA gets 90.5% weight (which already contains historical data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Recent price gets MORE than the average weight (9.5% vs 5%)!\n",

    "## 🎯 When to Use Which?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use SMA When:\n",
    "✅ You're a **long-term investor** (holding for months/years)\n",
    "✅ You want **fewer false signals**\n",
    "✅ You trade **less volatile stocks**\n",
    "✅ You want to match **institutional analysis** (banks use SMA 200)\n",
    "✅ You prefer **simplicity and stability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use EMA When:\n",
    "✅ You're a **day trader or swing trader** (holding for days/weeks)\n",
    "✅ You want **early trend detection**\n",
    "✅ You trade **volatile stocks** (high price swings)\n",
    "✅ You want to catch **quick momentum changes**\n",
    "✅ You prefer **aggressive entry/exit points**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practice: Use BOTH! 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional traders often use both:\n",
    "- **Long-term trend**: Check SMA 200\n",
    "- **Entry/exit timing**: Use EMA 20 or EMA 50\n",
    "- **Confirmation**: When both agree, signal is stronger!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Do They Matter So Much?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Institutional Attention** 📊\n",
    "   - Banks, hedge funds, and pension funds watch the 200-day MA religiously\n",
    "   - When SMA 50 crosses it, algorithms trigger automatic buys/sells\n",
    "   - This creates MASSIVE volume and momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy** 🔄\n",
    "   - Because everyone watches these signals, they actually work!\n",
    "   - When Golden Cross forms → Many buy → Price goes up → Signal confirmed\n",
    "   - When Death Cross forms → Many sell → Price goes down → Signal confirmed\n",

    "3. **Long-Term Trend Confirmation** ✅\n",
    "   - These aren't quick day-trading signals\n",
    "   - They confirm MAJOR trend changes\n",
    "   - Think months or years, not days or weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Market Sentiment Shift** 💭\n",
    "   - Golden Cross = \"The dark times are over, good times ahead\"\n",

    "## ⚠️ Important Warnings!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lagging Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem**: By the time these crosses occur, the trend has often already started\n",
    "- Golden Cross appears AFTER the bottom (not at the bottom)\n",
    "- Death Cross appears AFTER the top (not at the top)\n",
    "- You'll miss the first 10-20% of the move\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution**: Don't use alone - combine with other indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. False Signals (Whipsaws)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem**: Sometimes crosses occur but the trend doesn't follow through\n",
    "- Price might cross back quickly (called a \"whipsaw\")\n",
    "- Especially common in sideways/choppy markets\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution**: Wait for confirmation\n",
    "- Check if price stays above/below both MAs for at least 2-3 weeks\n",
    "- Look for increasing volume during the cross\n",
    "- Use other indicators (RSI, MACD) to confirm\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Best in Trending Markets Only\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Problem**: In sideways markets, you'll get many false crosses\n",
    "- SMA 50 and SMA 200 get tangled up\n",
    "- Crosses happen frequently with no follow-through\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Solution**: Only trade these signals when there's a clear long-term trend forming\n",

    "## 📊 How to Use Them Correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ DO:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use as confirmation** - Not as your only signal\n",
    "2. **Check the context** - What's the overall market doing?\n",
    "3. **Look at volume** - High volume cross = more reliable\n",
    "4. **Be patient** - These are LONG-TERM signals (months, not days)\n",
    "5. **Combine with fundamentals** - Is the company actually doing well?\n",
    "6. **Wait for follow-through** - Give it 2-3 weeks to confirm\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't panic sell/buy immediately** - Wait for confirmation\n",
    "2. **Don't use in choppy markets** - You'll get whipsawed\n",
    "3. **Don't expect perfect timing** - You'll miss some of the move (that's okay!)\n",
    "4. **Don't ignore other factors** - Check news, fundamentals, volume\n",
    "5. **Don't use for day trading** - These are long-term signals\n",
    "6. **Don't forget risk management** - Always use stop losses!\n",

    "# Part 5: MA Crossover Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is MA Crossover Strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Moving Average Crossover Strategy** is one of the simplest and most popular trading systems. It uses crossovers between a **fast MA** (short period) and a **slow MA** (long period) to generate buy and sell signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of waiting for the Golden/Death Cross (50/200), we use SHORTER-term MAs for more frequent trading signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Pairs:**\n",
    "- SMA 20 / SMA 50 (what we'll use - good for swing trading)\n",
    "- EMA 12 / EMA 26 (popular for day trading)\n",
    "- SMA 10 / SMA 30 (for very short-term trading)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Strategy Rules (Simple Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟢 BUY SIGNAL\n",
    "\n",
    "**When**: Fast MA (SMA 20) crosses **ABOVE** slow MA (SMA 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**: \n",
    "- Short-term trend is becoming stronger than medium-term trend\n",
    "- Recent prices are rising faster than historical average\n",
    "- Bullish momentum is building\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action**: \n",
    "- Enter a LONG position (buy the stock)\n",
    "- Place stop loss below recent support or below SMA 50\n",
    "- Target profit: Next resistance level or ride the trend\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔴 SELL SIGNAL\n",
    "\n",
    "**When**: Fast MA (SMA 20) crosses **BELOW** slow MA (SMA 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**:\n",
    "- Short-term trend is becoming weaker than medium-term trend\n",
    "- Recent prices are falling faster than historical average\n",
    "- Bearish momentum is building\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action**:\n",
    "- Exit LONG position (sell the stock)\n",
    "- If you're a short seller: Enter SHORT position (advanced)\n",
    "- Move to cash and wait for next buy signal\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💪 Advantages of MA Crossover Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple to Understand** 📚\n",
    "   - Clear, objective rules (no guesswork)\n",
    "   - Easy to backtest and verify\n",
    "   - Beginners can learn it quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removes Emotion** 🧘\n",
    "   - No \"should I buy now or wait?\"\n",
    "   - System tells you exactly when to act\n",
    "   - Prevents panic selling or FOMO buying\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Captures Trends** 📈\n",
    "   - Works excellently in strong trending markets\n",
    "   - Keeps you in winning trades longer\n",
    "   - \"Ride the wave\" instead of trying to pick tops/bottoms\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automated Trading** 🤖\n",
    "   - Can be programmed into trading bots\n",
    "   - No need to watch charts all day\n",
    "   - Set alerts and execute when signals trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Works Across Markets** 🌍\n",
    "   - Stocks, forex, crypto, commodities\n",
    "   - Any timeframe (daily, hourly, weekly)\n",
    "   - Universal principle\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Disadvantages (Be Aware!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lagging Indicator** 🐢\n",
    "   - Signals come AFTER trend has started\n",
    "   - You'll miss the first 10-20% of moves\n",
    "   - Late entry = less profit potential\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **False Signals in Choppy Markets** 〰️\n",
    "   - Sideways/ranging markets generate many bad signals\n",
    "   - You'll get \"whipsawed\" (buy high, sell low repeatedly)\n",
    "   - Can lead to death by a thousand cuts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Profit Targets** 🎯\n",
    "   - System doesn't tell you WHERE to take profit\n",
    "   - You might give back gains waiting for exit signal\n",
    "   - Need additional rules for profit-taking\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Frequent Trading (Short Periods)** 💸\n",
    "   - Using fast MAs (10/20) = more signals = more commissions\n",
    "   - Transaction costs can eat into profits\n",
    "   - More active monitoring required\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Requires Discipline** 🛡️\n",
    "   - Hard to follow during losing streaks\n",
    "   - Temptation to override signals\n",
    "   - Need strict risk management\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 How to Use It Correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose the Right MA Periods**\n",
    "   - Your trading style determines the periods\n",
    "   - Day trader: EMA 12/26 or SMA 10/30\n",
    "   - Swing trader: SMA 20/50 (our example)\n",
    "   - Position trader: SMA 50/200 (Golden/Death Cross)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use in Trending Markets Only**\n",
    "   - Before entering, confirm there's a trend\n",
    "   - Check higher timeframe (is SMA 200 sloping?)\n",
    "   - Avoid during consolidation/sideways periods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Filters to Reduce False Signals**\n",
    "   - Volume confirmation: High volume on crossover = more reliable\n",
    "   - RSI filter: Only buy if RSI > 50 (bullish momentum)\n",
    "   - Trend filter: Only take signals in direction of SMA 200\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Stop Losses** 🛡️\n",
    "   - Never trade without stops!\n",
    "   - Stop loss below recent swing low (for longs)\n",
    "   - Or fixed % below entry (e.g., 5-10%)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Take Partial Profits**\n",
    "   - Don't wait for exit signal to take ALL profits\n",
    "   - Sell 50% at +10%, let rest ride\n",
    "   - Lock in gains to protect against whipsaws\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Track Your Results** 📊\n",
    "   - Keep a trading journal\n",
    "   - Calculate win rate and average profit/loss\n",
    "   - Adjust strategy based on results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Enhanced Strategy (Pro Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Confirmation Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just blindly follow crossovers. Add these confirmations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For BUY Signal (SMA 20 crosses above SMA 50):**\n",
    "1. ✅ Check price is above SMA 200 (long-term uptrend)\n",
    "2. ✅ Check volume is above average (strong interest)\n",
    "3. ✅ Check RSI is between 50-70 (bullish but not overbought)\n",
    "4. ✅ Check MACD also bullish (we'll learn this in next notebook!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For SELL Signal (SMA 20 crosses below SMA 50):**\n",
    "1. ✅ Check price is below SMA 200 (long-term downtrend)\n",
    "2. ✅ Check volume is above average\n",
    "3. ✅ Check RSI is between 30-50 (bearish but not oversold)\n",
    "4. ✅ Check MACD also bearish\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Fewer signals, but MUCH higher quality!\n",

    "# Part 6: Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've just mastered one of the most important topics in technical analysis. Let's recap everything:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Core Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Moving Averages Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **What they are**: Average prices over a specific period, smoothing out noise\n",
    "✅ **Why they matter**: Show trend direction, act as support/resistance, generate signals\n",
    "✅ **How they work**: Rolling window that moves forward with time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: MAs are like the \"center line\" of price movement - they show where the stock \"wants\" to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **SMA vs EMA**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | SMA | EMA |\n",
    "|--------|-----|-----|\n",
    "| **Weighting** | Equal | More weight to recent |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Slower | Faster |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Long-term investing | Active trading |\n",
    "| **Noise** | Filters more | Filters less |\n",
    "| **Signals** | Fewer, more reliable | More, less reliable |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: SMA = stability and confirmation. EMA = speed and early signals. Use both!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Common MA Periods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SMA/EMA 20**: Short-term trend (~1 month) - for day/swing traders\n",
    "- **SMA/EMA 50**: Medium-term trend (~2-3 months) - for swing/position traders\n",
    "- **SMA 200**: Long-term trend (~10 months) - THE MOST WATCHED by institutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: The 200-day MA is the \"line in the sand\" - institutions make major decisions based on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **Golden Cross & Death Cross**\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 **Golden Cross** (SMA 50 crosses above SMA 200):\n",
    "- Major bullish signal\n",
    "- Confirms transition from bear to bull market\n",
    "- Often makes financial news headlines\n",
    "\n",
    "☠️ **Death Cross** (SMA 50 crosses below SMA 200):\n",
    "- Major bearish signal\n",
    "- Confirms transition from bull to bear market\n",
    "- Warning sign for long-term investors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: These are lagging indicators - they confirm trends but don't predict them. Wait for confirmation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ **MA Crossover Trading Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 **Simple Rules**:\n",
    "- **Buy**: When fast MA crosses above slow MA (bullish momentum)\n",
    "- **Sell**: When fast MA crosses below slow MA (bearish momentum)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Works great in trending markets, terrible in sideways markets. Always add filters and confirmations!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Most Important Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Price Above MA = Bullish, Price Below MA = Bearish\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundation of everything. When price is above its MA:\n",
    "- The stock is in an uptrend\n",
    "- The MA often acts as support\n",
    "- Pullbacks to the MA are buying opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "When price is below its MA:\n",
    "- The stock is in a downtrend\n",
    "- The MA often acts as resistance\n",
    "- Rallies to the MA are selling opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multiple Timeframe Confirmation is Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just look at one MA! Check multiple:\n",
    "- **All MAs sloping up + price above all** = STRONG UPTREND\n",
    "- **All MAs sloping down + price below all** = STRONG DOWNTREND\n",
    "- **MAs tangled/flat** = SIDEWAYS MARKET (avoid trading!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. MAs Are Lagging Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "This is CRITICAL to understand:\n",
    "- MAs tell you where the stock HAS BEEN, not where it's GOING\n",
    "- By the time you get a signal, the trend has already started\n",
    "- You'll miss the first 10-20% of every move (accept this!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use MAs for confirmation, not prediction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. No Indicator Works Alone\n",
    "\n",
    "Always combine MAs with:\n",
    "- **Volume**: High volume confirms the signal\n",
    "- **Price action**: Look for candlestick patterns\n",
    "- **Other indicators**: RSI, MACD (we'll learn these next!)\n",
    "- **Fundamentals**: Is the company actually doing well?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Discipline Beats Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "The best strategy is useless if you don't follow it:\n",
    "- Set your rules and stick to them\n",
    "- Use stop losses ALWAYS\n",
    "- Don't override signals based on \"gut feeling\"\n",
    "- Keep a trading journal to track your results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 How to Interpret MAs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 1: Position Relative to MA\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Price > MA = Bullish ✅\n",
    "Price = MA = Neutral ↔️\n",
    "Price < MA = Bearish ⚠️\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 2: MA Slope Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MA Slope Up ↗️ = Uptrend strengthening\n",
    "MA Slope Flat → = Sideways market\n",
    "MA Slope Down ↘️ = Downtrend strengthening\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 3: Distance from MA\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Price FAR above MA = Overbought (expect pullback)\n",
    "Price NEAR MA = Normal, healthy\n",
    "Price FAR below MA = Oversold (expect bounce)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule 4: MA Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fast MA > Slow MA = Bullish momentum\n",
    "Fast MA = Slow MA = Trend changing\n",
    "Fast MA < Slow MA = Bearish momentum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using MAs in Choppy Markets ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: In sideways markets, you get whipsawed (false signals constantly)\n",
    "**Solution**: Check if there's a clear trend first. If MAs are flat/tangled, don't trade!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Not Waiting for Confirmation ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Jumping in immediately on every crossover\n",
    "**Solution**: Wait 2-3 days after crossover. Make sure it's not a false signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ignoring Volume ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Taking signals with no volume confirmation\n",
    "**Solution**: Crossovers with high volume are more reliable. Check volume!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Using Only One MA Period ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Missing the big picture\n",
    "**Solution**: Always check multiple timeframes (20, 50, 200). They tell different stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Forgetting Stop Losses ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: One bad trade wipes out weeks of gains\n",
    "**Solution**: ALWAYS use stop losses. No exceptions. 5-10% below entry is standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Expecting Perfect Timing ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Getting frustrated when MA signals are late\n",
    "**Solution**: Accept that MAs are lagging. You'll miss some profits but avoid many false starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Overtrading on Short Periods ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Using very fast MAs (5/10) and trading every signal\n",
    "**Solution**: Longer periods (20/50) give fewer but higher quality signals. Less is more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Not Backtesting ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Trading a strategy without knowing if it works\n",
    "**Solution**: Test your strategy on historical data first! Track win rate and average return.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Does this improve the win rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backtest on Other Stocks**\n",
    "   - Test the SMA 20/50 strategy on 5 different Malaysian stocks\n",
    "   - Which stocks does it work best on?\n",
    "   - Trending stocks or volatile stocks?\n",

    "## 🌟 Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moving Averages are the foundation of technical analysis.** Once you master them, everything else becomes easier:\n",
    "- RSI is just momentum relative to price\n",
    "- MACD is just the relationship between two EMAs\n",
    "- Bollinger Bands are just MAs with standard deviations\n",

    "**You've taken a huge step in your trading journey!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep practicing, keep learning, and remember:\n",
    "- 💡 The market rewards patience\n",
    "- 💡 Discipline beats intelligence\n",
    "- 💡 Risk management is more important than entry timing\n",
    "- 💡 No strategy wins 100% of the time (even 60% is excellent!)\n",
