    "\n",
    "### What is Volatility?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatility** measures how much and how quickly a stock's price changes. It's one of the most important concepts in trading!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Volatility Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of volatility like weather patterns:\n",
    "- **Low Volatility** = Calm, predictable weather (gentle price movements)\n",
    "- **High Volatility** = Stormy, unpredictable weather (wild price swings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Traders:**\n",
    "1. **Risk Assessment**: High volatility = higher risk (and potentially higher reward)\n",
    "2. **Stop-Loss Placement**: Volatile stocks need wider stop-losses\n",
    "3. **Position Sizing**: Should risk less on volatile stocks\n",
    "4. **Strategy Selection**: Different strategies work in different volatility environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low Volatility Stock (Maybank - Blue Chip):**\n",
    "- Monday: RM 9.00\n",
    "- Tuesday: RM 9.05\n",
    "- Wednesday: RM 9.03\n",
    "- Thursday: RM 9.07\n",
    "- Friday: RM 9.04\n",
    "- *Daily change: ~0.5%* → Predictable, safer\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Volatility Stock (Small Cap Tech):**\n",
    "- Monday: RM 1.00\n",
    "- Tuesday: RM 1.15 (+15%!)\n",
    "- Wednesday: RM 0.95 (-17%!)\n",
    "- Thursday: RM 1.08 (+13%!)\n",
    "- Friday: RM 0.98 (-9%!)\n",
    "- *Daily change: ~10-15%* → Unpredictable, risky\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility is **neither good nor bad** - it's simply information!\n",
    "- High volatility = More opportunity (and more risk)\n",
    "- Low volatility = Less opportunity (and less risk)\n",
    "- **The key is matching your strategy to the volatility environment!**\n",

    "## Part 3: Bollinger Bands - Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Bollinger Bands?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bollinger Bands** were created by John Bollinger in the 1980s. They consist of **three lines**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Middle Band** = 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)\n",
    "2. **Upper Band** = Middle Band + (2 × Standard Deviation)\n",
    "3. **Lower Band** = Middle Band - (2 × Standard Deviation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What Do They Tell Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands create a **dynamic envelope** around price that:\n",
    "- **Expands** during high volatility (bands widen)\n",
    "- **Contracts** during low volatility (bands narrow)\n",
    "- Shows **overbought** conditions when price near upper band\n",
    "- Shows **oversold** conditions when price near lower band\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Bollinger Bands like a **rubber band**:\n",
    "- When price touches the upper band → rubber band stretched UP (may snap back)\n",
    "- When price touches the lower band → rubber band stretched DOWN (may snap back)\n",
    "- When bands are narrow → rubber band relaxed (big move coming soon!)\n",
    "- When bands are wide → rubber band stretched (volatility high, may calm down)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 20/2 Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default Settings: 20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why these numbers?\n",
    "- **20 periods** = Roughly one trading month (20-22 trading days)\n",
    "- **2 standard deviations** = Statistically, ~95% of price action stays within the bands\n",
    "- **When price goes outside** = Statistically rare event (potential reversal!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"What goes up must come down, and what goes down must come up\"** - BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY!\n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands help us identify:\n",
    "1. When price has moved too far, too fast (stretched bands)\n",
    "2. When a big move is about to happen (squeezed bands)\n",
    "3. The general trend direction (price position relative to middle band)\n",

    "## Part 5: The Bollinger Band Squeeze\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Squeeze?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Bollinger Band Squeeze** occurs when the bands contract to their narrowest width. This indicates:\n",
    "- Very low volatility\n",
    "- Market consolidation\n",
    "- A big move is likely coming soon!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Squeezes Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a squeeze like a **coiled spring**:\n",
    "- The tighter the squeeze → The bigger the potential release\n",
    "- Markets alternate between low volatility (squeeze) and high volatility (expansion)\n",
    "- Traders position themselves BEFORE the breakout\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Identify a Squeeze\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Band Width Indicator**: When BB Width is at multi-month lows\n",
    "2. **Visual**: Bands look very narrow on the chart\n",
    "3. **%B Indicator**: Price oscillating between 0.3 and 0.7 (stuck in middle)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trading the Squeeze\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**:\n",
    "1. Identify when bands are at their narrowest (squeeze)\n",
    "2. Wait for breakout (price closes outside the bands)\n",
    "3. Enter in direction of breakout\n",
    "4. Place stop-loss on opposite band\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Squeeze identified (narrow bands)\n",
    "- Price breaks ABOVE upper band → Buy signal\n",
    "- Stop-loss at lower band\n",

    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Using BB in Strong Trends\n",
    "**Mistake**: Shorting at upper band during strong uptrend\n",
    "**Why it fails**: In trends, price can \"walk the band\" for extended periods\n",
    "**Solution**: Use BB with trend indicators (above middle = uptrend)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ignoring ATR When Setting Stops\n",
    "**Mistake**: Using fixed percentage stops (always 5%)\n",
    "**Why it fails**: Doesn't account for stock's volatility\n",
    "**Solution**: Use ATR-based stops (2 × ATR)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Trading Every Band Touch\n",
    "**Mistake**: Buying every lower band touch automatically\n",
    "**Why it fails**: Not all touches result in bounces\n",
    "**Solution**: Wait for confirmation (bullish candle, RSI oversold, volume)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Wrong Squeeze Interpretation\n",
    "**Mistake**: Buying during squeeze before breakout\n",
    "**Why it fails**: Don't know which direction it will break\n",
    "**Solution**: Wait for breakout THEN trade in that direction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Forgetting the Market Environment\n",
    "**Mistake**: Using bounce strategy in trending market\n",
    "**Why it fails**: Different strategies for different environments\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Ranging market → Bounce strategy\n",
