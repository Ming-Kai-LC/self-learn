## How to Use This Glossary

- Terms are organized alphabetically
- Each term includes:
  - 📖 Simple definition
  - 💡 Why it matters
  - 📝 Example (where applicable)
- Words in *italics* have their own entries in this glossary

---

## A

### Accumulation
📖 **Definition**: Period when smart investors are quietly buying a stock before the price rises significantly.

💡 **Why it matters**: If you spot accumulation early (rising *OBV* with stable prices), you might catch a stock before it rallies.

📝 **Example**: Stock price stays at RM 1.00 for weeks, but volume keeps increasing. This could be accumulation.

---

### Ask Price
📖 **Definition**: The lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a stock.

💡 **Why it matters**: If you want to buy immediately, you pay the ask price. Lower ask = better deal for buyers.

📝 **Example**: Ask price is RM 1.25. If you place a market order to buy, you'll pay RM 1.25.

---

### Average True Range (ATR)
📖 **Definition**: Measure of how much a stock's price typically moves (volatility) in a given period.

💡 **Why it matters**: Helps you set realistic *stop loss* levels. High ATR = need wider stop loss.

📝 **Example**: Stock with ATR of RM 0.10 typically moves 10 sen per day.

---

## B

### Bear Market
📖 **Definition**: Extended period (months/years) where stock prices are falling. Opposite of *Bull Market*.

💡 **Why it matters**: Different trading strategies work in bear vs bull markets. In bear markets, consider cash or short positions.

📝 **Example**: 2008 Financial Crisis was a bear market - most stocks fell 30-50%.

---

### Bearish
📖 **Definition**: Negative outlook expecting prices to fall. Someone who is bearish thinks prices will go down.

💡 **Why it matters**: Bearish signals (like *Death Cross*) suggest you should sell or avoid buying.

📝 **Example**: "I'm bearish on this stock" = "I think this stock will go down."

---

### Bid Price
📖 **Definition**: The highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock.

💡 **Why it matters**: If you want to sell immediately, you receive the bid price. Higher bid = better deal for sellers.

📝 **Example**: Bid price is RM 1.23. If you place a market order to sell, you'll get RM 1.23.

---

### Blue Chip Stock
📖 **Definition**: Stock of a large, established, financially sound company with history of reliable performance.

💡 **Why it matters**: Blue chips (like Maybank, Public Bank) are less risky but offer lower growth potential.

📝 **Example**: Malaysian blue chips include Maybank (1155.KL), Tenaga (5296.KL), Public Bank (1295.KL).

---

### Bollinger Bands
📖 **Definition**: Three lines plotted around price: middle line (20-day MA), upper band (+2 standard deviations), lower band (-2 standard deviations).

💡 **Why it matters**: When price touches upper band = possibly overbought. Lower band = possibly oversold.

📝 **Example**: Price repeatedly bouncing between RM 1.00 (lower band) and RM 1.20 (upper band).

---

### Breakout
📖 **Definition**: When price moves above a *resistance* level or below a *support* level with high *volume*.

💡 **Why it matters**: Breakouts often signal the start of a strong trend. High probability trading opportunity.

📝 **Example**: Stock stuck at RM 1.20 for months, then breaks above it with high volume → bullish breakout!

---

### Bull Market
📖 **Definition**: Extended period (months/years) where stock prices are rising. Opposite of *Bear Market*.

💡 **Why it matters**: Most beginners make money in bull markets. Strategy: buy dips, avoid fighting the trend.

📝 **Example**: 2020-2021 post-COVID recovery was a bull market - most stocks surged.

---

### Bullish
📖 **Definition**: Positive outlook expecting prices to rise. Someone who is bullish thinks prices will go up.

💡 **Why it matters**: Bullish signals (like *Golden Cross*) suggest it's a good time to buy.

---

## C

### Candlestick
📖 **Definition**: Chart format that shows *OHLCV* data for a time period in a visual "candle" shape.

💡 **Why it matters**: Candlesticks reveal market psychology better than line charts. Patterns predict future moves.

---

### Close (Closing Price)
📖 **Definition**: The final price at which a stock traded when the market closed for the day.

💡 **Why it matters**: Most important price of the day! Technical indicators use closing prices.

---

### Consolidation
📖 **Definition**: Period when price moves sideways in a tight range, taking a "break" after a big move.

💡 **Why it matters**: Consolidation often precedes a breakout. Like a spring being compressed before releasing.

---

### Correction
📖 **Definition**: Short-term price decline (typically 10-20%) in an overall uptrend.

💡 **Why it matters**: Corrections are NORMAL and healthy. Not the same as a *bear market*. Good buying opportunities.

---

### Crossover
📖 **Definition**: When one line (indicator or *moving average*) crosses above or below another line.

💡 **Why it matters**: Crossovers generate trading signals. *Golden Cross* and *MACD* crossovers are examples.

---

## D

### Day Trading
📖 **Definition**: Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day. All positions closed before market closes.

---

### Death Cross
📖 **Definition**: When a short-term *moving average* (like 50-day) crosses BELOW a long-term MA (like 200-day).

---

### Distribution
📖 **Definition**: Period when smart investors are quietly selling a stock before the price falls significantly.

💡 **Why it matters**: Opposite of *accumulation*. If you spot it (*OBV* falling while price stable), exit before crash!

📝 **Example**: Price stays at RM 1.50 but volume increasing with more down days = distribution happening.

---

### Divergence
📖 **Definition**: When price and an indicator (like *RSI* or *MACD*) move in opposite directions.

💡 **Why it matters**: Divergence warns of trend reversal! Very powerful signal for experienced traders.

📝 **Example**: Price makes new high at RM 1.60, but RSI peaks lower than before = bearish divergence (sell signal).

---

### Downtrend
📖 **Definition**: Pattern where stock price consistently makes lower *highs* and lower *lows*.

---

## E

### EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
📖 **Definition**: Type of *moving average* that gives more weight to recent prices. Responds faster to price changes than *SMA*.

💡 **Why it matters**: Better for short-term trading. Catches trends earlier but gives more false signals.

📝 **Example**: 12-day EMA reacts to price changes faster than 12-day SMA.

---

### Entry Point
📖 **Definition**: The price level at which you decide to buy a stock.

💡 **Why it matters**: Good entry = better profits, less risk. Wait for confirmation signals before entering.

📝 **Example**: Wait for price to break above RM 1.25 resistance before entering, rather than buying at RM 1.24.

---

### Exit Point
📖 **Definition**: The price level at which you decide to sell a stock (either for profit or loss).

---

## F

### False Breakout (Fake Breakout)
📖 **Definition**: When price briefly moves above *resistance* or below *support*, then quickly reverses.

💡 **Why it matters**: Prevents trading against the larger trend. Monthly shows direction, daily shows entry.

📝 **Example**: Monthly = uptrend, Weekly = uptrend, Daily = pullback → Buy the pullback!

---

### Portfolio Heat
📖 **Definition**: Total percentage of your account at risk across ALL open positions.

💡 **Why it matters**: Limits total exposure. Maximum recommended: 6% (e.g., 3 positions × 2% each).

📝 **Example**: 4 positions each risking 2% = 8% portfolio heat. TOO HIGH! Close a position.

---

### Position Sizing
📖 **Definition**: Calculating how many shares to buy based on your risk tolerance and stop-loss distance.

💡 **Why it matters**: Most important risk management skill. Prevents over-risking on volatile stocks.

📝 **Example**: Account = RM 10,000, Risk 2% (RM 200), Entry RM 1.50, Stop RM 1.40 → Buy 2,000 shares.

**Formula**: Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / (Entry - Stop Loss)

---

### Retracement
📖 **Definition**: Temporary reversal in the direction of the trend before continuing.

💡 **Why it matters**: Retracements are buying opportunities in uptrends, selling opportunities in downtrends.

📝 **Example**: Stock in uptrend pulls back 38% (retracement) then continues higher.

---

### Risk-Reward Ratio
📖 **Definition**: Comparison of potential loss vs potential profit. Formula: (Target - Entry) / (Entry - Stop)

💡 **Why it matters**: Never take trades with less than 1:2 ratio. With 1:2, you only need 33% win rate to profit!

📝 **Example**: Risk RM 0.10 to make RM 0.20 = 1:2 ratio. GOOD! Risk RM 0.10 to make RM 0.05 = 1:0.5. BAD!

---

### Screening (Stock Screening)
📖 **Definition**: Automatically filtering hundreds/thousands of stocks based on technical criteria.

💡 **Why it matters**: Saves hours of manual analysis. Finds best opportunities quickly.

📝 **Example**: Screen for: RSI < 30, Price > 200 SMA, Volume > average. Results = potential buy candidates.

---

### Squeeze (Bollinger Band Squeeze)
📖 **Definition**: When *Bollinger Bands* contract to their narrowest width, indicating very low volatility.

💡 **Why it matters**: After squeeze, expect explosive breakout. "The calm before the storm."

📝 **Example**: Bands narrow for weeks → then price breaks out strongly with high volume.

---

### Stochastic Oscillator
📖 **Definition**: *Momentum* indicator with two lines (%K and %D) that oscillates between 0-100. Shows overbought (>80) and oversold (<20) conditions.

💡 **Why it matters**: Alternative to RSI. Crossovers in extreme zones give trading signals.

📝 **Example**: %K crosses above %D in oversold zone (<20) = buy signal.

---

### Swing High and Swing Low
📖 **Definition**: Local peaks (swing high) and valleys (swing low) in price action.

💡 **Why it matters**: Used to calculate *Fibonacci Retracements* and identify *support* and *resistance*.

📝 **Example**: Find recent swing low (RM 1.00) and swing high (RM 1.50) to draw Fibonacci levels.

---

### Timeframe Alignment
📖 **Definition**: When multiple timeframes (monthly, weekly, daily) all show the same trend direction.

💡 **Why it matters**: Strongest trading setups occur when all timeframes align.

📝 **Example**: Monthly uptrend + Weekly uptrend + Daily uptrend = STRONG BUY signal.

---

### Top-Down Analysis
📖 **Definition**: Starting analysis from longest timeframe (monthly) down to shortest (daily).

💡 **Why it matters**: Prevents fighting the larger trend. Always trade in direction of higher timeframe.

📝 **Example**: 1) Check monthly (direction), 2) Check weekly (confirmation), 3) Enter on daily (timing).

---

### Williams %R
📖 **Definition**: *Momentum* oscillator similar to Stochastic but inverted (ranges from 0 to -100). More sensitive than Stochastic.

💡 **Why it matters**: Catches reversals earlier than Stochastic. Good for early signals.

📝 **Example**: Williams %R < -80 (oversold) → watch for buy signal. Williams %R > -20 (overbought) → watch for sell signal.
