    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand how oscillators measure momentum\n",
    "- Calculate and interpret the Stochastic Oscillator\n",
    "- Use Williams %R for momentum analysis\n",
    "- Detect divergences (hidden trading opportunities)\n",
    "- Combine multiple oscillators for stronger signals\n",
    "- Apply oscillator-based trading strategies\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",

    "- Completed Modules 00-07\n",

    "### What are Oscillators?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oscillators** are technical indicators that fluctuate between fixed bounds (usually 0-100). They help identify:\n",
    "- Overbought conditions (potential sell signals)\n",
    "- Oversold conditions (potential buy signals)\n",
    "- Momentum shifts\n",
    "- Divergences from price\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of oscillators like a **pendulum**:\n",
    "- When it swings too far right (overbought) → It must swing back left\n",
    "- When it swings too far left (oversold) → It must swing back right\n",
    "- The center represents equilibrium\n",
    "- The speed of swing shows momentum\n",

    "### Oscillators vs Trend Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Oscillators | Trend Indicators |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Range** | Bounded (0-100) | Unbounded |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Ranging markets | Trending markets |\n",
    "| **Signals** | Overbought/oversold | Trend direction |\n",
    "| **Examples** | RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R | Moving Averages, MACD |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multiple Oscillators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different oscillators have different strengths:\n",
    "- **RSI** = Fast, responsive (from Module 04)\n",
    "- **Stochastic** = Shows momentum + direction\n",
    "- **Williams %R** = Very sensitive, catches early reversals\n",

Did Williams %R signal earlier than Stochastic?\\n3. Which oscillator do you find easier to interpret?\\n\\n### Exercise 2: Try Different Stocks\\nAnalyze different stocks and compare oscillator behavior:\\n- **1155.KL** (Maybank - large cap)\\n- **5296.KL** (Tenaga - utility)\\n\\nQuestions:\\n1. Which stock shows more overbought/oversold signals?\\n2. Do oscillators work better on volatile or stable stocks?\\n\\n### Exercise 3: Backtest a Strategy\\nChoose the Double Confirmation strategy:\\n1. Find last 3 buy signals\\n2. Check what happened to price after each signal\\n3. Calculate win rate (how many were profitable?)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What's Next?\\n\\nCongratulations on completing Module 08!\\n\\n**Next Module: Fibonacci Retracements & Support/Resistance Zones**\\n\\nIn Module 09, you'll learn:\\n- Fibonacci retracement levels\\n- Support and resistance zones\\n- Combining Fibonacci with oscillators\\n- Entry and exit optimization\\n\\n**File**: `09_fibonacci_support_resistance.ipynb`\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Happy Trading!
