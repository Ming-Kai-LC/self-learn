    "\n",
    "### Recommended Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete one module at a time** - Don't rush through\n",
    "2. **Run every code cell** - Learning by doing is essential\n",
    "3. **Experiment** - Try changing parameters and see what happens\n",
    "4. **Take breaks** - Technical analysis has many concepts; give yourself time to absorb them\n",
    "5. **Come back to review** - Revisit earlier modules as you progress\n",

    "### Module Roadmap\n",
    "\n",

    "### Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Read the explanations carefully\n",
    "- Run all code cells in order\n",
    "- Experiment with different stocks (try others after completing UUE)\n",
    "- Take notes on concepts that are new to you\n",
    "- Complete the practice exercises at the end of each module\n",
    "- Ask questions (research unfamiliar terms)\n",

    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Skip ahead without understanding previous concepts\n",
    "- Just read without running the code\n",
    "- Get discouraged if something doesn't work - debugging is part of learning\n",
