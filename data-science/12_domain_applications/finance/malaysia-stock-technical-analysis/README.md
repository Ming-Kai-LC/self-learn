# 📈 Malaysian Stock Technical Analysis - Learning Journey

A comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to learning technical analysis using real Malaysian stock data. This project focuses on **UUE Holdings Berhad (Stock Code: 0310)** as a practical case study to master technical analysis concepts.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is designed for **complete beginners** who want to learn how technical analysis can help make informed investment decisions in Malaysian stocks (KLSE/Bursa Malaysia). Through hands-on Jupyter notebooks, you'll track real-world stock prices and learn to analyze them using proven technical indicators.

### Why This Project?

- **Beginner-Friendly**: No prior technical analysis knowledge required
- **Real-World Data**: Work with actual Malaysian stock prices (UUE and others)
- **Hands-On Learning**: Interactive notebooks with code examples and exercises
- **Practical Focus**: Learn by doing, not just reading theory
- **Free Tools**: All data sources are free and legal (Yahoo Finance)
- **Malaysian Market**: Specifically tailored for KLSE stocks

### Focus Stock: UUE Holdings Berhad

We use **0310.KL** (UUE Holdings Berhad) as our primary learning example, but the concepts apply to all Malaysian stocks.

**Why 0310.KL?** Malaysian stocks use numeric codes on Bursa Malaysia. The ticker format is `[Stock Code].KL` where `.KL` indicates Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.

A: No! We use Yahoo Finance which is completely free and legal.

**Q: Can I use this for other stocks besides UUE?**
A: Yes! All concepts work for any KLSE stock (just change the ticker).

**Q: How accurate is technical analysis?**
A: It's a tool, not a crystal ball. Always combine with other analysis methods.
