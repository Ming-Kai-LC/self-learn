    "## What is Claude Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings Claude AI directly into your development workflow. Unlike using the Claude API, Claude Code is designed for **interactive development** with:\n",
    "- Direct file system access\n",
    "- Git integration\n",
    "- Command execution\n",
    "- Project-aware context\n",
    "- Specialized sub-agents\n",
    "- Custom workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as having an AI pair programmer who can see your entire project, run commands, edit files, and help you throughout the development process."

    "#### Execute Mode (Default)\n",
    "- Claude can read, write, edit files\n",
    "- Run commands\n",
    "- Make git commits\n",
    "- Full interactive development\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plan Mode (Shift+Tab twice)\n",
    "- Research and analysis only\n",
    "- Read-only access\n",
    "- Perfect for exploration\n",

    "## Built-in Slash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Code comes with 30+ built-in commands. Here are the most important ones:\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "- Use `/clear` when starting a new task\n",
    "- Use `/compact` when running low on tokens but want to keep context\n",
    "- Use `/rewind` when you want to undo recent changes\n",

    "## Best Practices for Beginners\n",

    "### 1. Start in Plan Mode for Exploration\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Shift+Tab twice]\n",
    "\"Explain how this codebase is structured\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This lets you learn about your project without risk of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Be Specific in Requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ \"Fix the code\"\n",
    "✅ \"The login function in auth.py is throwing a KeyError on line 42. \n",
    "    Can you help debug this?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Git Branches\n",
    "```\n",
    "Always work on a branch when making changes:\n",
    "\"Create a new branch called 'feature/user-auth' and implement user authentication\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Review Before Committing\n",
    "```\n",
    "Always review Claude's changes before committing:\n",
    "- Read the diff\n",
    "- Test the code\n",
    "- Ensure it meets requirements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Clear Context Between Tasks\n",
    "```\n",
    "When switching tasks, use /clear to start fresh and avoid context confusion\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Ask for Explanations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Can you explain why you chose this approach?\"\n",
    "\"What are the trade-offs of this implementation?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Iterate and Refine\n",
    "```\n",
    "First request: \"Create a user registration endpoint\"\n",
    "Follow-up: \"Add email validation\"\n",
    "Follow-up: \"Add rate limiting to prevent spam\"\n",
