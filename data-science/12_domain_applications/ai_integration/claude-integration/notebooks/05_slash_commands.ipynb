    "## What Are Slash Commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "Slash commands are **reusable prompts** that you can invoke with a simple `/command-name` syntax. They're like keyboard shortcuts for complex instructions!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instead of typing this repeatedly:**\n",

    "ensure documentation is updated, and check for breaking changes\n",

    "\n",
    "❌ Bad:\n",

    "### 2. Comprehensive Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "✅ Good:\n",
    "description: Comprehensive PR review checking code quality, security, tests, and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad:\n",
    "description: Review code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Structured Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Use numbered lists and clear sections:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "✅ Good:\n",
    "Review the code for:\n",
    "1. **Security** - Check for vulnerabilities\n",
    "2. **Quality** - Assess code organization\n",
    "3. **Tests** - Verify coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad:\n",
    "Review the code for security, quality, and tests.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Specify Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Provide output as:\n",
    "- 🔴 Critical: Issues that must be fixed\n",
    "- 🟡 Warning: Issues that should be fixed  \n",
    "- 🟢 Info: Suggestions for improvement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Include Context\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "Follow our coding standards:\n",
    "- Use TypeScript strict mode\n",
    "- 100% test coverage for services\n",
    "- ESLint must pass with zero warnings\n",
    "- Follow component structure in CONVENTIONS.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "If tests fail:\n",
    "1. Show which tests failed\n",
    "2. Explain the failure reason\n",
    "3. Suggest fixes\n",
    "4. Do not proceed with deployment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Make Commands Reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "✅ Good - Works for any language:\n",
    "Generate tests for {{args}} following the project's testing conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad - Too specific:\n",
    "Generate Jest tests using React Testing Library for the UserProfile component.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Add Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "---\n",
    "description: Create a new microservice\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Not Found\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** `/my-command` says \"command not found\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Check file location:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ls .claude/commands/\n",
    "   ls ~/.claude/commands/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Verify filename matches command:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Command: /my-command\n",
    "   File: my-command.md  ✅\n",
    "   File: my_command.md  ❌\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Restart Claude Code to reload commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Not Executing as Expected\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Command runs but doesn't do what you want\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Make instructions more explicit\n",
    "2. Add numbered steps\n",
    "3. Specify output format clearly\n",
    "4. Test with simpler version first\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments Not Working\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** `{{args}}` shows up literally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Verify syntax: `{{args}}` not `{args}` or `$args`\n",
    "2. Make sure you're passing arguments:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   /my-command some arguments  ✅\n",
    "   /my-command                ❌ (if args required)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### YAML Frontmatter Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Command file not loading\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Check YAML syntax:\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   ✅ Correct:\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   description: My command\n",
    "   tags: [test, dev]\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "\n",
    "   ❌ Wrong:\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   description: My command\n",
    "   tags: [test, dev]\n",
    "   --  (missing third dash)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Validate YAML:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Extract and validate frontmatter\n",
    "   sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p' .claude/commands/my-command.md | yq\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Too Slow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Command takes too long to execute\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. Break into smaller commands\n",
    "2. Make steps optional: \"Only run tests if requested\"\n",
    "3. Use faster model for simple tasks\n",
    "4. Cache results when possible\n",
    "\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slash commands are reusable prompts** stored as markdown files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two storage locations:**\n",
    "   - `.claude/commands/` for project-specific commands\n",
    "   - `~/.claude/commands/` for user-wide commands\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Commands accept arguments** using `{{args}}`, `{{arg1}}`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structure matters:**\n",
    "   - Clear descriptions\n",
    "   - Numbered steps\n",
    "   - Explicit output format\n",
    "   - Error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commands can chain** for complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Organize for teams:**\n",
    "   - Use directories\n",
    "   - Follow naming conventions\n",
    "   - Document in README\n",
    "   - Version control commands\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Test thoroughly** before sharing with team\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Iterate based on feedback** to improve commands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams using slash commands report:\n",
    "- **50% faster** code reviews\n",
    "- **Consistent quality** across team\n",
    "- **Faster onboarding** for new developers\n",
    "- **Captured expertise** in shareable format\n",
    "- **Reduced meetings** (workflows documented as commands)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand slash commands, continue to:\n",
    "- **Notebook 06:** MCP Integrations - Connect external services\n",
    "- **Notebook 07:** Tools Mastery - Master Claude's built-in tools\n",
