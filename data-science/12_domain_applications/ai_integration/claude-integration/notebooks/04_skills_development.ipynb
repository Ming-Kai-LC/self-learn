    "- **Reusable workflows** - Consistent approaches to common tasks\n",

This clarity will help you choose the right tool for each task.\n\n### Comparison Table\n\n| Feature | Purpose | Execution | Context | Best For |\n|---------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| **Skills** | Reusable prompts/workflows | Within main conversation | Shared with main thread | Structured tasks, templates, workflows |\n| **Sub-agents** | Specialized AI assistants | Separate conversation thread | Isolated context | Complex analysis, parallel work, delegation |\n| **Hooks** | Automated event triggers | On specific events (startup, pre-commit) | Background automation | Validation, setup, cleanup |\n\n### When to Use Skills\n\n✅ **Use Skills when you need:**\n- Repeatable workflows (code review, testing patterns)\n- Structured output formats (reports, documentation)\n- Templates and boilerplate generation\n- Quick access to specialized prompts\n- Knowledge you want to share easily\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- \"Generate API documentation in our standard format\"\n- \"Create a React component with our team's patterns\"\n- \"Review this PR using our checklist\"\n\n### When to Use Sub-agents\n\n✅ **Use Sub-agents when you need:**\n- Isolated analysis (security audit without changing code)\n- Specialized expertise (Python expert, React expert)\n- Parallel processing (multiple tasks simultaneously)\n- Different tool permissions (read-only reviewer)\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- \"Audit the entire codebase for security issues\"\n- \"Analyze performance bottlenecks\"\n- \"Review architecture without making changes\"\n\n### When to Use Hooks\n\n✅ **Use Hooks when you need:**\n- Automatic execution (no manual trigger)\n- Event-driven workflows (on session start, before commit)\n- Validation and checks (lint before commit)\n- Environment setup (install dependencies on start)\n\n**Example use cases:**\n- \"Run tests before every commit\"\n- \"Check code style automatically\"\n- \"Set up development environment on session start\"\n\n### Combining All Three\n\n```\nScenario: Comprehensive Code Quality System\n\n1. Hook (SessionStart): Runs linters and tests on startup\n2. Skill (code-review): Provides structured code review workflow\n3. Sub-agent (security-auditor): Deep security analysis in isolation\n\nWorkflow:\n- Session starts → Hook runs checks\n- Developer: \"Review my changes\" → Skill provides structured review\n- Developer: \"Security audit\" → Sub-agent performs deep analysis\n```"

    "### 2. Comprehensive Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Include all necessary information:**\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "✅ Good skill instructions:\n",
    "   - What to do (objectives)\n",
    "   - How to do it (process)\n",
    "   - What format to output (structure)\n",
    "   - Examples of good output\n",

    "   - \"Review the code\"\n",
    "   - \"Make it better\"\n",
    "   - \"Fix issues\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use Templates and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Include templates in skill directory:**\n",
    "```\n",
    ".claude/skills/api-generator/\n",
    "├── SKILL.md\n",
    "└── templates/\n",
    "    ├── route-handler.js\n",

    "\n",
    "### 7. Test Your Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before deploying:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Test automatic invocation\n",
    "   \"Generate an API endpoint\" → Should invoke api-generator\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test explicit invocation\n",
    "   \"Use the api-generator skill\" → Should work\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test with various inputs\n",
    "   - Simple cases\n",
    "   - Complex cases\n",
    "   - Edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Verify output quality\n",
    "   - Follows instructions?\n",
    "   - Correct format?\n",
    "   - Handles edge cases?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Keep Skills Focused\n",
    "\n",
    "**One skill, one purpose:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Good: \"code-review\" skill - Reviews code\n",
    "✅ Good: \"test-generator\" skill - Generates tests\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Bad: \"code-helper\" skill - Reviews, generates, tests, documents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** Focused skills are:\n",
    "- Easier to maintain\n",
    "- More predictable\n",

    "**Checklist:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "✓ File is named SKILL.md (case-sensitive)\n",
    "✓ File is in correct location:\n",
    "  - .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md OR\n",
    "  - ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md\n",
    "✓ YAML frontmatter is valid\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Include trigger keywords in description:**\n",

    "**Problem:** Skill fails to load\n",

    "❌ Missing closing ---\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: skill\n",
    "description: test\n",
    "(missing ---)\n",

    "### Skill Produces Inconsistent Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Output varies each time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **Be more specific in instructions:**\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   ❌ \"Generate tests\"\n",
    "   ✅ \"Generate exactly 3 types of tests:\n",
    "       1. Happy path test\n",
    "       2. Error handling test\n",
    "       3. Edge case test\n",
    "       Use AAA pattern for each.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide templates:**\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   Use this exact format:\n",
    "   ```[language]\n",
    "   [template code]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add examples:**\n",

    "   [show complete example]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skill Can't Find Templates/Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Skill references files that aren't found\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **Use relative paths from skill directory:**\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   Read the template at templates/component.tsx\n",
    "   (relative to .claude/skills/skill-name/)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check file exists:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ls .claude/skills/skill-name/templates/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify permissions:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod +r .claude/skills/skill-name/templates/*\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conflicts Between Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Multiple skills triggered by same request\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "1. **Make descriptions more specific:**\n",
    "   ```markdown\n",
    "   ❌ Both triggered by \"review code\":\n",
    "   skill-1 description: Review code\n",
    "   skill-2 description: Code review\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ✅ Differentiate clearly:\n",
    "   skill-1 description: Security-focused code review for vulnerabilities\n",
    "   skill-2 description: Performance-focused code review for optimization\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use explicit invocation:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \"Use the security-review skill\"\n",
    "   \"Use the performance-review skill\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skill Not Working After Update\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Modified skill doesn't reflect changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
