    "\n",
    "Sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that Claude can delegate tasks to. Each sub-agent:\n",
    "- Has a **dedicated purpose** (e.g., code review, testing, documentation)\n",
    "- Operates in an **isolated context** (separate conversation thread)\n",
    "- Has **configurable tool access** (read-only, write, execute, etc.)\n",
    "- Follows **custom instructions** tailored to its role\n",
    "- Can be invoked **automatically** or **explicitly**\n",

    "✅ Reviewers get read-only: [Read, Grep, Glob]\n",
    "❌ Everyone gets full access: [\"*\"]\n",

    "### 3. Use Appropriate Models\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "✅ Explorers use haiku for speed\n",
    "✅ Reviewers use sonnet for quality\n",
    "✅ Critical security audits use opus\n",

    "### 4. Focused Instructions\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "✅ Specific checklist of what to review\n",
    "❌ \"Review the code and make it better\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Reusable Across Projects\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Store general-purpose agents in ~/.claude/agents/\n",
    "✅ Store project-specific agents in .claude/agents/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Test Before Deploying\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Create the agent\n",
    "2. Test with sample code\n",
    "3. Verify tool permissions work\n",
