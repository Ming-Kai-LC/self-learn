# Domain Applications

Real-world applications in specific domains (Finance, Web, AI Integration).

## Overview

Domain applications demonstrate how data science skills apply to specific industries and use cases. According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Domain expertise (38% of jobs seek domain experts) in finance, healthcare, manufacturing, or e-commerce commands premium compensation and differentiation."**

These projects showcase:
- Industry-specific knowledge
- Practical problem-solving
- End-to-end application development
- Integration with real-world systems

## Learning Path

**Approach**:
1. Complete core DS foundations first
2. Choose domain based on interest and career goals
3. Build domain expertise through projects
4. Network in chosen industry
5. Target roles in that domain

## Prerequisites

- **Core data science skills** from earlier domains
- **Industry interest** in chosen domain
- Willingness to learn domain-specific concepts

## What You'll Achieve

After completing domain projects, you will:
- Demonstrate industry-specific knowledge
- Build practical applications
- Speak the language of the domain
- Network with industry professionals
- Differentiate yourself from generalists
- Command higher compensation

## Career Strategy

**Generalist vs Specialist**:
- **Generalist**: Broader opportunities, easier job search
- **Specialist**: Higher pay, deeper expertise, niche roles

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Build strong DS foundations (generalist)
2. Develop 1-2 domain specializations
3. Market yourself as "T-shaped" professional

## Next Steps

- Continue building in chosen domain
- Network at industry events
- Follow domain-specific publications
