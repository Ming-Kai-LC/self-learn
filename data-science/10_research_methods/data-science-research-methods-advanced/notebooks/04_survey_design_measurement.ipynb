    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time**: 50 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design** effective survey questions that minimize bias and maximize clarity\n",
    "2. **Select** appropriate response scales for different question types\n",
    "3. **Evaluate** psychometric properties: reliability (consistency) and validity (accuracy)\n",
    "4. **Calculate** Cronbach's alpha and other reliability metrics\n",
    "5. **Identify** and mitigate common survey biases (acquiescence, social desirability, etc.)\n",
    "6. **Distinguish** between measurement scales (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)\n",
    "7. **Conduct** item analysis to refine survey instruments\n",
    "8. **Implement** survey pretesting and cognitive interviewing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad measurement = bad data = bad science**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the most sophisticated analysis cannot overcome poor measurement:\n",
    "- Ambiguous questions lead to meaningless responses\n",
    "- Biased questions distort reality\n",
    "- Unreliable measures add noise and reduce power\n",
    "- Invalid measures answer the wrong question\n",
    "\n",
    "This module teaches you to create measurement instruments that are:\n",
    "- **Reliable**: Consistent across time and contexts\n",
    "- **Valid**: Actually measure what they claim to measure\n",
    "- **Unbiased**: Minimize systematic distortions\n",
    "- **Actionable**: Produce data you can trust"

    "### The Seven Deadly Sins of Survey Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Double-Barreled Questions\n",
    "**Bad**: \"Do you think the government should increase taxes and improve healthcare?\"\n",
    "- Problem: Two questions in one. What if someone supports one but not the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: Split into two questions:\n",
    "- \"Should the government increase taxes?\"\n",
    "- \"Should the government improve healthcare?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Leading Questions\n",
    "**Bad**: \"Don't you agree that climate change is the most important issue facing humanity?\"\n",
    "- Problem: Guides respondent toward a particular answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: \"How important is climate change relative to other issues?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Loaded Questions\n",
    "**Bad**: \"Should we allow dangerous criminals to walk free?\"\n",
    "- Problem: Emotional language biases response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: \"Should non-violent offenders be eligible for early release?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Ambiguous Questions\n",
    "**Bad**: \"How often do you exercise?\"\n",
    "- Problem: What counts as exercise? Walking? Housework? Sports?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: \"In a typical week, on how many days do you engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Negatively Worded Questions\n",
    "**Bad**: \"To what extent do you disagree that you are not dissatisfied with our service?\"\n",
    "- Problem: Double/triple negatives confuse respondents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: \"How satisfied are you with our service?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Questions Assuming Knowledge\n",
    "**Bad**: \"What is your opinion on the proposed amendment to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code?\"\n",
    "- Problem: Most respondents won't know what this is\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: Include brief explanation or add \"Don't know\" option\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Questions Beyond Recall Ability\n",
    "**Bad**: \"How many times did you sneeze in the past year?\"\n",
    "- Problem: No one can accurately remember this\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: Shorten timeframe: \"How many times did you sneeze today?\""

    "\n",
    "### Common Scale Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Likert Scales\n",
    "**Usage**: Measuring agreement, frequency, importance, satisfaction\n",

    "**Example (5-point agreement)**:\n",
    "1. Strongly Disagree\n",
    "2. Disagree\n",
    "3. Neither Agree nor Disagree\n",
    "4. Agree\n",
    "5. Strongly Agree\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Choices**:\n",
    "- **Number of points**: 5-7 is standard (more points ≠ more precision)\n",
    "- **Middle option**: Include neutral option? (Yes: allows true neutrality; No: forces choice)\n",
    "- **Labels**: Label all points vs. only endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Differential Scales\n",
    "**Usage**: Measuring attitudes along bipolar dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please rate this product:\n",
    "Inexpensive  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  Expensive\n",

    "Unattractive 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  Attractive\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Analog Scales (VAS)\n",
    "**Usage**: Continuous measurement (pain, satisfaction, emotion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "How much pain are you experiencing?\n",
    "|------------------------------------------------|\n",

    "```\n",

    "Respondent marks on the line; researcher measures distance.\n",

    "**Example (0-10 scale)**:\n",
    "\"On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is 'not at all likely' and 10 is 'extremely likely', how likely are you to recommend our product?\"\n",

    "**Validity** = Accuracy of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid measure actually measures what it claims to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Reliability is necessary but not sufficient for validity.\n",
    "- A bathroom scale could consistently show you weigh 150 lbs (reliable)\n",
    "- But if you actually weigh 180 lbs, it's not valid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Face Validity\n",
    "**Definition**: Does it appear to measure what it claims?\n",
    "**Assessment**: Subjective expert judgment\n",
    "**Example**: \"I feel sad\" has face validity for depression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Content Validity\n",
    "**Definition**: Does it cover the full domain of the construct?\n",
    "**Assessment**: Expert review\n",
    "**Example**: A math test should cover all relevant topics, not just geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Criterion Validity\n",
    "**Definition**: Does it correlate with an external criterion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subtypes**:\n",
    "- **Concurrent validity**: Correlates with criterion measured at same time\n",
    "  - Example: New depression scale correlates with established BDI\n",
    "- **Predictive validity**: Predicts future outcomes\n",
    "  - Example: SAT scores predict college GPA\n",

    "#### 4. Construct Validity\n",
    "**Definition**: Does it behave as theory predicts?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subtypes**:\n",
    "- **Convergent validity**: Correlates with measures of related constructs\n",
    "  - Example: Depression scale correlates with anxiety scale\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pretesting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Cognitive Interviewing\n",
    "**Process**: Ask participants to \"think aloud\" while completing survey\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**:\n",
    "- Identify confusing questions\n",
    "- Understand how respondents interpret questions\n",
    "- Detect missing response options\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example questions to ask**:\n",
    "- \"What does this question mean to you?\"\n",
    "- \"How did you arrive at your answer?\"\n",
    "- \"Was anything confusing or unclear?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample size**: 5-15 participants per round\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Pilot Testing\n",
    "**Process**: Administer survey to small sample under realistic conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**:\n",
    "- Test survey flow and timing\n",
    "- Check skip logic and branching\n",
    "- Examine response distributions\n",
    "- Calculate preliminary reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample size**: 30-50 participants (from target population)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Expert Review\n",
    "**Process**: Subject matter experts review questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**:\n",
    "- Assess content validity\n",
    "- Identify biased or leading questions\n",
    "- Ensure comprehensiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reviewers**: 3-5 experts in the domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Flags in Pilot Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High non-response**: Question may be sensitive or confusing\n",
    "2. **All choose same option**: Question not discriminating\n",
    "3. **High \"Other\" selection**: Missing important response categories\n",
    "4. **Low reliability (α < 0.70)**: Items don't cohere\n",
    "5. **Unexpected patterns**: May indicate misunderstanding\n",

    "### Pretesting Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "□ Conduct cognitive interviews (n ≥ 5)\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Golden Rules of Survey Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep it simple**: One idea per question\n",
    "2. **Avoid bias**: Neutral wording, balanced options\n",
    "3. **Be specific**: Define terms, specify timeframes\n",
    "4. **Match scales to constructs**: Choose appropriate response formats\n",
    "5. **Test psychometric properties**: Reliability and validity are non-negotiable\n",
    "6. **Pretest extensively**: Cognitive interviews → Pilot → Revise → Repeat\n",
    "7. **Monitor data quality**: Detect and handle biased responses\n",
    "8. **Document everything**: Question development, changes, decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability vs. Validity Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Is your measure RELIABLE (consistent)?\n",
    "    │\n",
    "    NO → Fix it! (Review items, increase length, train raters)\n",
    "    │\n",
    "    YES → Is it VALID (accurate)?\n",
    "           │\n",
    "           NO → It's consistently measuring the WRONG thing\n",
    "           │     └─> Assess construct validity, revise items\n",
    "           │\n",
    "           YES → Good to go! (But keep monitoring)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Skipping pretesting  \n",
    "❌ Using double-barreled questions  \n",
    "❌ Leading or loaded language  \n",
    "❌ Assuming all Likert scales are reliable  \n",
    "❌ Ignoring scale type when analyzing  \n",
    "❌ Not checking for response biases  \n",
    "❌ Deploying without pilot testing  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Use validated measures when available  \n",
    "✓ Include reverse-coded items  \n",
    "✓ Add attention checks  \n",
    "✓ Calculate Cronbach's α (target: ≥ 0.70)  \n",
    "✓ Assess validity (convergent, discriminant, criterion)  \n",
    "✓ Screen for biased response patterns  \n",
    "✓ Report psychometric properties in publications  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can create measurement instruments that produce trustworthy data. The next module covers **sampling strategies**, teaching you how to select representative samples for your surveys and studies."
