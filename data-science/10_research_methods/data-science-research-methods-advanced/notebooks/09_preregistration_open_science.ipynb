    "### The Problem: Questionable Research Practices (QRPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preregistration** is the practice of publicly documenting research plans (hypotheses, methods, analyses) before data collection begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common QRPs that preregistration prevents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **P-hacking** (Data dredging): Testing multiple analyses and reporting only significant results\n",
    "2. **HARKing** (Hypothesizing After Results are Known): Presenting exploratory findings as confirmatory\n",
    "3. **Selective reporting**: Omitting non-significant results or conditions\n",
    "4. **Flexible stopping**: Collecting data until significance is reached\n",
    "5. **Optional outlier exclusion**: Removing data points to achieve significance\n",

First, we originally planned to use ANOVA but discovered severe violations of homogeneity of variance (Levene's test, p < .001), so we used Welch's ANOVA instead. Second, we preregistered N = 200 but only recruited N = 156 due to pandemic-related disruptions. Our sensitivity analysis indicated we still had 80% power to detect d = 0.46, slightly larger than our anticipated d = 0.40. In addition to our confirmatory analyses, we report exploratory analyses of potential moderators in Appendix B.\"*\n",
