    "\n",
    "Report if you have:\n",
    "- **Reasonable belief** (not just suspicion) of misconduct\n",

    "### How to Report\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Document Everything\n",
    "   - What you observed\n",
    "   - When and where\n",
    "   - Any evidence\n",
    "   - Who else knows\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider Informal Resolution First\n",
    "   - Talk to the person (if safe to do so)\n",
    "   - Maybe it was an honest mistake\n",
    "   - Give them chance to correct\n",

    "3. If Informal Doesn't Work, Report to:\n",

    "   - Department chair\n",
    "   - Institutional Research Integrity Officer\n",
    "   - Funding agency (NIH, NSF, etc.)\n",

    "4. Protections\n",
    "   - U.S. law protects whistleblowers from retaliation\n",
    "   - You can report anonymously\n",
    "   - Institution required to investigate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens After Report\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inquiry**: Preliminary assessment (30-60 days)\n",
    "2. **Investigation**: If inquiry finds merit, formal investigation (120 days)\n",
    "3. **Decision**: Finding of misconduct or not\n",
    "4. **Sanctions**: If misconduct confirmed\n",
    "   - Retraction of papers\n",
    "   - Return of funds\n",
    "   - Debarment from federal funding\n",
    "   - Termination\n",
