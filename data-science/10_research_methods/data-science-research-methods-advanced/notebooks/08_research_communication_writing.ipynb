    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structure** scientific papers using IMRaD format\n",
    "2. **Write** clear, concise abstracts (structured and unstructured)\n",
    "3. **Craft** compelling introductions that justify research\n",
    "4. **Present** methods with sufficient detail for reproducibility\n",
    "5. **Report** results objectively without interpretation\n",
    "6. **Discuss** findings in context of existing literature\n",
    "7. **Create** effective tables and figures following APA/journal guidelines\n",
    "8. **Avoid** common writing pitfalls and improve clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Great research poorly communicated is wasted research.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective communication:\n",
    "- **Determines** whether work gets published\n",

    "- **Enables** others to build on your work\n",
    "- **Advances** scientific knowledge\n",
    "- **Secures** funding and collaborations\n",
