    "By the end of this module, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Distinguish correlation from causation\n",
    "2. ✅ Identify and understand confounding variables\n",
    "3. ✅ Apply Bradford Hill criteria for causal inference\n",
    "4. ✅ Create and interpret Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "5. ✅ Understand different causal scenarios (mediation, colliders)\n",
    "6. ✅ Know when causal claims are justified\n",

    "### The Danger of Confusing Correlation with Causation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Famous Examples:**\n",
    "- Ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths\n",
    "- Shoe size correlates with reading ability in children\n",
    "- Number of fire fighters correlates with fire damage\n",
    "\n",
    "**None of these are causal!** All have confounders:\n",
    "- Ice cream & drowning: Temperature (summer)\n",
    "- Shoe size & reading: Age\n",
    "- Firefighters & damage: Fire severity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters in Research\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy decisions need causation:**\n",

    "- Does education *cause* higher income?\n",
    "- Does exercise *cause* better health?\n",

    "### Three Possible Explanations for Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "When X and Y are correlated, there are several possible explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. X → Y (X causes Y)\n",
    "Example: Smoking → Lung cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Y → X (Y causes X - reverse causation)\n",
    "Example: Does depression cause unemployment, or does unemployment cause depression?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Z → X and Z → Y (Confounding)\n",
    "Example: Temperature causes both ice cream sales and drowning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Coincidence\n",
    "Spurious correlation by chance\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Gold Standard: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why RCTs establish causation:**\n",
    "- Random assignment breaks all confounding\n",
    "- Only thing that differs is the treatment\n",
    "- Any difference in outcomes must be due to treatment\n",

    "## Part 3: Bradford Hill Criteria for Causation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill proposed criteria for judging whether an observed association is likely causal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** These are GUIDELINES, not rules. No single criterion is necessary or sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Nine Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Strength of Association**\n",
    "- Stronger associations more likely causal\n",
    "- Example: Smoking has very strong association with lung cancer (RR > 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Consistency**\n",
    "- Replicated across different studies, populations, settings\n",
    "- Example: Smoking-cancer link found worldwide\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Specificity**\n",
    "- Specific exposure → specific outcome\n",
    "- Example: Asbestos → mesothelioma (rare cancer)\n",
    "- Note: NOT required for causation (smoking causes many diseases)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Temporality**\n",
    "- **REQUIRED**: Cause must precede effect\n",
    "- Example: Exposure to carcinogen before cancer develops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Biological Gradient (Dose-Response)**\n",
    "- More exposure → stronger effect\n",
    "- Example: More cigarettes per day → higher cancer risk\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Plausibility**\n",
    "- Biologically plausible mechanism\n",
    "- Example: Carcinogens damage DNA → cancer\n",
    "- Limited by current knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Coherence**\n",
    "- Consistent with known facts about disease\n",
    "- Doesn't contradict existing knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Experiment**\n",
    "- Experimental evidence (RCT or natural experiment)\n",
    "- Gold standard when available\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Analogy**\n",
    "- Similar causes have similar effects\n",
    "- Example: If one drug in a class is teratogenic, others may be too\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Bradford Hill\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong causal evidence when:**\n",
    "- ✅ Temporality established\n",
    "- ✅ Strong, consistent association\n",
    "- ✅ Dose-response relationship\n",
    "- ✅ Plausible mechanism\n",
    "- ✅ Experimental support\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaker evidence when:**\n",
    "- ❓ Only cross-sectional data (can't establish temporality)\n",
    "- ❓ Weak or inconsistent associations\n",
    "- ❓ No dose-response\n",
    "- ❓ Many plausible confounders"

    "3. **Bradford Hill Criteria**\n",
    "   - Framework for evaluating causal evidence\n",
    "   - Temporality is essential\n",
    "   - Other criteria strengthen case\n",

    "   - Rules for what to control\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Causal Inference Standards**\n",
    "   - RCTs are gold standard\n",
    "   - Observational studies can suggest causation\n",

    "| **Mediators** | DON'T control (blocks causal path) |\n",
    "| **Colliders** | DON'T control (creates bias) |\n",
    "| **Temporality** | ESSENTIAL for causation |\n",
    "| **Randomization** | Breaks all confounding |\n",
