    "\n",
    "The research question is the **foundation** of your entire project. A well-formulated question guides everything that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Good Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "A good research question should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Clear and Specific**\n",
    "- Everyone should understand exactly what you're asking\n",
    "- No ambiguous terms\n",
    "- Well-defined scope\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad**: \"How does technology affect people?\"\n",
    "- What technology? Which people? Affect how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: \"How does smartphone screen time (>4 hours/day) affect sleep quality in college students aged 18-24?\"\n",
    "- Specific technology, population, and outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Focused (Not Too Broad)**\n",
    "- Can be answered within your time and resource constraints\n",
    "- One main question, not multiple questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too Broad**: \"What is the best machine learning algorithm?\"\n",
    "- Best for what? Under what conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focused**: \"Which algorithm (Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Network) performs best for predicting customer churn in e-commerce with imbalanced datasets?\"\n",
    "- Specific algorithms, specific task, specific context\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Researchable**\n",
    "- Can actually be investigated with available methods\n",
    "- Data can be collected or accessed\n",
    "- Ethical to study\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not Researchable**: \"What do aliens think about human AI?\"\n",
    "- Can't collect data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Researchable**: \"What do AI researchers think about the risks of advanced AI?\"\n",
    "- Can survey or interview researchers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Original and Meaningful**\n",
    "- Adds something new to the field\n",
    "- Matters to someone (academics, practitioners, society)\n",
    "- Not already definitively answered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not Original**: \"Does increasing sample size improve model performance?\"\n",
    "- Well-established fact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original**: \"At what sample size do deep learning models for rare disease diagnosis reach acceptable performance?\"\n",
    "- Specific, practical question with implications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Complex (Not Yes/No)**\n",
    "- Requires analysis, not just a simple answer\n",
    "- Often starts with \"How\", \"Why\", \"What factors\", \"To what extent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too Simple**: \"Do people use social media?\"\n",
    "- Yes. End of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex**: \"What factors influence social media usage patterns among Gen Z users?\"\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good research questions** are clear, focused, researchable, original, and complex\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use FINER criteria** to evaluate: Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Hypotheses are testable predictions** with clear IV, DV, and direction\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Choose methodology** based on your question: quantitative, qualitative, or mixed\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Avoid common pitfalls**: too broad, too narrow, unfocused, non-testable\n",
