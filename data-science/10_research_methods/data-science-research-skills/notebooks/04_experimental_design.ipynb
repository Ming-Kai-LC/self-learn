    "### Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Independent Variable (IV)\n",
    "\n",

    "**Also called**: \n",
    "- Predictor variable\n",
    "- Treatment variable\n",
    "- Explanatory variable\n",

    "- Algorithm type (LSTM vs ARIMA)\n",
    "- Feature set (with/without RFM features)\n",
    "- Training data size\n",
    "- Learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point**: This is what you control in the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Dependent Variable (DV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: The variable you measure (the outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also called**:\n",
    "- Outcome variable\n",
    "- Response variable\n",
    "- Measured variable\n",

    "- Researcher experience\n",
    "- Time of day for data collection\n",

    "#### 4. Control Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Confounding variables that you **hold constant**\n",

    "- Use same dataset for all algorithms\n",
    "- Use same hardware for all tests\n",

    "## Part 2: Experimental Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Good experiments follow these core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Randomly assign subjects/samples to different groups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: \n",
    "- Eliminates selection bias\n",
    "- Balances unknown confounds across groups\n",
    "- Allows for statistical inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When testing a new algorithm\n",
    "- ❌ **Bad**: Test on easy data samples, compare to hard samples\n",
    "- ✅ **Good**: Randomly split data into train/test, apply both algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Control Group\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: A baseline group for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Shows what would happen without the treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Testing a new feature engineering technique\n",
    "- **Treatment group**: Model with new features\n",
    "- **Control group**: Model with original features\n",
    "- **Compare**: Difference in performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Repeat the experiment multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**:\n",
    "- Reduces impact of random variation\n",
    "- Increases confidence in results\n",
    "- Helps detect real effects vs noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- Run model training 10 times with different random seeds\n",
    "- Report mean and standard deviation\n",
    "- Not just one lucky run!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Blinding\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Keeping participants/researchers unaware of group assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**:\n",
    "- **Single-blind**: Participants don't know their group\n",
    "- **Double-blind**: Neither participants nor researchers know\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: Prevents bias in measurement or behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in ML**:\n",
    "- Have someone else evaluate model outputs\n",
    "- Don't tell them which algorithm produced which results\n",
    "- Prevents confirmation bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Number of observations/samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: \n",
    "- Too small: Can't detect real effects\n",
    "- Too large: Wastes resources\n",
    "- Just right: Adequate statistical power\n",

    "- Group B: Algorithm 2\n",
    "- Compare accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Simple, easy to analyze\n",
    "**Cons**: Can only test one factor at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design 2: Factorial Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Test multiple factors simultaneously\n",
    "\n",

    "Factor A: Algorithm (LSTM vs ARIMA)\n",

    "4 Conditions:\n",
    "1. LSTM + Basic\n",
    "2. LSTM + Advanced\n",
    "3. ARIMA + Basic\n",
    "4. ARIMA + Advanced\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Cons**: \n",
    "- More complex\n",
    "- Larger sample size needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design 3: Before-After (Within-Subjects)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Measure same subjects before and after treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Measure model performance with current features\n",
    "- Add new features\n",
    "- Measure performance again\n",
    "- Compare difference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Controls for individual differences\n",
    "**Cons**: Order effects, can't \"unlearn\" what was learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design 4: Crossover Design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Each group gets both treatments in different order\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Period 1      Period 2\n",
    "Group 1: A  →  B\n",
    "Group 2: B  →  A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**: Want benefits of within-subjects but need to control order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**: Controls for order effects\n",
    "**Cons**: More complex, time-consuming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design 5: Stratified Random Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**: Divide into strata, then randomize within each\n",
