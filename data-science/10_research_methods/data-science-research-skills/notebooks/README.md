## How to Use These Notebooks

### Running a Notebook

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the notebook** you want to work on

3. **Run cells sequentially** using Shift+Enter

4. **Complete exercises** as you encounter them

5. **Save your work** regularly with Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)

### Tips for Success

- **Don't skip ahead** - Each module builds on previous concepts
- **Run all code cells** - Don't just read, execute the code!
- **Modify and experiment** - Try changing parameters to see what happens
- **Do the exercises** - They reinforce what you've learned
- **Take notes** - Add your own markdown cells with insights
- **Revisit difficult concepts** - It's okay to go back and review

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Jupyter)

**Command Mode** (press Esc to enter):
- `A` - Insert cell above
- `B` - Insert cell below
- `DD` - Delete cell
- `M` - Change cell to Markdown
- `Y` - Change cell to Code

**Edit Mode** (press Enter to enter):
- `Shift+Enter` - Run cell and move to next
- `Ctrl+Enter` - Run cell and stay
- `Alt+Enter` - Run cell and insert below

## Outputs Folder

Each notebook will save generated files to its own subfolder:
- `outputs/notebook_00/` - Files from Module 00
- `outputs/notebook_01/` - Files from Module 01
- etc.

This keeps your workspace organized!

## Exercises Folder

Contains practice exercises and solutions for each module:
- **Exercises** - Try these on your own first
- **Solutions** - Check these after attempting the exercises

## Getting Help

### If a cell produces an error:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check for typos in your code
3. Make sure you ran previous cells
4. Restart the kernel and run all cells: `Kernel > Restart & Run All`

### If you're stuck on a concept:
1. Re-read the explanation in the notebook
2. Check the main README for additional resources
3. Try the simpler exercises first
4. Look up the topic in the additional resources

### If imports fail:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
# Install/update requirements
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```
