    "## Part 1: Core Ethical Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Belmont Report (1979)\n",
    "\n",
    "Three foundational principles for ethical research with human subjects:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Respect for Persons\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means**:\n",
    "- Treat people as autonomous agents capable of making their own decisions\n",
    "- Protect those with diminished autonomy (children, prisoners, etc.)\n",
    "- Individuals should have choice about participating\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Data Science**:\n",
    "- ✅ Obtain informed consent before collecting personal data\n",
    "- ✅ Allow users to opt-out\n",
    "- ✅ Respect privacy preferences\n",
    "- ✅ Don't manipulate or deceive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- **Good**: \"We'd like to use your data for research. Click here to learn more and consent.\"\n",
    "- **Bad**: Scraping personal data without permission\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Beneficence\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means**:\n",
    "- Maximize benefits\n",
    "- Minimize harms\n",
    "- **Do no harm** (primum non nocere)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Data Science**:\n",
    "- ✅ Consider potential harms of your research\n",
    "- ✅ Benefits should outweigh risks\n",
    "- ✅ Monitor for unintended consequences\n",
    "- ✅ Have mechanisms to address harms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- **Good**: Testing medical AI extensively before deployment\n",
    "- **Bad**: Deploying undertested facial recognition in high-stakes settings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Harm to Consider**:\n",
    "- Physical harm\n",
    "- Psychological harm (stress, anxiety)\n",
    "- Social harm (discrimination, stigma)\n",
    "- Economic harm (job loss, denied services)\n",
    "- Legal harm (wrongful accusation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Justice\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means**:\n",
    "- Fair distribution of benefits and burdens of research\n",
    "- Don't exploit vulnerable populations\n",
    "- Those who bear risks should also receive benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Data Science**:\n",
    "- ✅ Ensure diverse representation in data\n",
    "- ✅ Test models across demographic groups\n",
    "- ✅ Don't use vulnerable populations unfairly\n",
    "- ✅ Consider who benefits and who bears costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- **Bad**: Train on data from wealthy patients, deploy in poor communities\n",
    "- **Good**: Ensure training data represents all groups who will use the system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Ethical Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Transparency\n",
    "- Be open about methods, data sources, limitations\n",
    "- Explain how models make decisions\n",
    "- Disclose conflicts of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Accountability\n",
    "- Take responsibility for your research impacts\n",
    "- Have mechanisms for addressing harms\n",
    "- Document decisions and rationale"

    "## Part 2: Privacy and Confidentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Privacy vs Confidentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Privacy**: Individuals' right to control their personal information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidentiality**: Researchers' duty to protect the information they collect\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Privacy Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Minimization\n",
    "**Principle**: Collect only what you need\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to ask**:\n",
    "- Do I really need this data?\n",
    "- Can I use aggregated/anonymized data instead?\n",
    "- How long do I need to keep it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Collect everything\n",
    "user_data = ['name', 'email', 'address', 'phone', 'SSN', \n",
    "             'credit_card', 'browsing_history', ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good: Collect only what's needed for research\n",
    "user_data = ['age_range', 'region', 'purchase_frequency']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Anonymization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Remove personally identifiable information (PII)\n",
    "\n",
    "**PII includes**:\n",
    "- Names\n",
    "- Email addresses\n",
    "- Phone numbers\n",
    "- Social security numbers\n",
    "- IP addresses\n",
    "- Exact locations\n",
    "- Photos of faces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Remove direct identifiers\n",
    "df = df.drop(columns=['name', 'email', 'ssn'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replace with pseudonyms\n",
    "df['user_id'] = df['user_id'].apply(lambda x: hashlib.sha256(x.encode()).hexdigest())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generalize data\n",
    "df['age'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=[0, 18, 30, 50, 65, 100], \n",
    "                   labels=['<18', '18-30', '30-50', '50-65', '65+'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add noise (differential privacy)\n",
    "df['income'] += np.random.laplace(0, 1000, len(df))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: Anonymization is HARD!\n",
    "- Even \"anonymized\" data can be re-identified\n",
    "- Combination of attributes can be unique\n",
    "- Example: ZIP code + birth date + gender identifies 87% of US population\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Secure Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices**:\n",
    "- ✅ Encrypt data at rest and in transit\n",
    "- ✅ Use access controls (who can see what)\n",
    "- ✅ Regular backups\n",
    "- ✅ Secure disposal when done\n",
    "- ✅ Audit logs\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Basic encryption\n",
    "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate key (store securely!)\n",
    "key = Fernet.generate_key()\n",
    "cipher = Fernet(key)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encrypt sensitive data\n",
    "encrypted = cipher.encrypt(b\"Sensitive data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Decrypt when needed\n",
    "decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Data Retention\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principle**: Don't keep data longer than necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**:\n",
    "- How long do I need this data?\n",
    "- What are legal requirements?\n",
    "- When and how will I delete it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a retention policy**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Raw data: Delete after 30 days\n",
    "Processed data: Keep for duration of study\n",
    "Published results: Keep indefinitely (but anonymized)\n",
    "```"

    "## Part 3: Informed Consent\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Informed Consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants must:\n",
    "1. **Understand** what they're agreeing to\n",
    "2. **Voluntarily** agree to participate\n",
    "3. Have **capacity** to consent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements of Informed Consent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Disclosure\n",
    "Tell participants:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: What is the research about?\n",
    "- **Procedures**: What will happen to their data?\n",
    "- **Risks**: What could go wrong?\n",
    "- **Benefits**: What might they gain?\n",
    "- **Alternatives**: What are their options?\n",
    "- **Privacy**: How will data be protected?\n",
    "- **Voluntary**: They can refuse or withdraw\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Comprehension\n",
    "Ensure they understand:\n",
    "- Use plain language (no jargon)\n",
    "- Appropriate reading level\n",
    "- Visual aids if helpful\n",
    "- Opportunity to ask questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Voluntariness\n",
    "No coercion or undue influence:\n",
    "- Free to decline\n",
    "- Can withdraw at any time\n",
    "- No penalties for refusing\n",

    "## Part 4: Bias and Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Bias in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Historical Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Bias already present in the world gets encoded in data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- Hiring data shows men in senior roles → Model learns to prefer men\n",
    "- Historical loan approvals favor certain demographics → Model perpetuates discrimination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: \n",
    "- Recognize historical inequalities\n",
    "- Don't blindly optimize for historical patterns\n",
    "- Consider fairness constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Representation Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Data doesn't represent the full population\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Facial recognition trained mostly on light-skinned faces\n",
    "- Medical AI trained only on data from one hospital\n",
    "- NLP models trained on English-only text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Ensure diverse, representative data\n",
    "- Report demographic breakdown of data\n",
    "- Test performance across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Measurement Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Systematic errors in how data is collected/measured\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Measuring \"job performance\" only by manager ratings (subjective)\n",
    "- Using arrest rates to predict crime (arrests ≠ crimes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Use validated measurements\n",
    "- Multiple measurement sources\n",
    "- Acknowledge measurement limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Aggregation Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: One model for all groups when different groups need different models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Diabetes risk model trained on general population doesn't work well for specific ethnic groups\n",
    "- One-size-fits-all recommendation ignoring user diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Test model performance by subgroup\n",
    "- Consider group-specific models\n",
    "- Or: features that capture relevant differences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Evaluation Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Testing on non-representative data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Test set differs from deployment population\n",
    "- Only evaluating on easy/common cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "- Ensure test set represents deployment setting\n",
    "- Stratified sampling\n",
    "- Report performance by subgroup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Different notions of fairness (often in tension!):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Demographic Parity\n",
    "**Definition**: Equal prediction rates across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Both groups should have similar positive prediction rates\n",
    "pred_rate_group_a = (predictions[group_a] == 1).mean()\n",
    "pred_rate_group_b = (predictions[group_b] == 1).mean()\n",
    "# Should be similar\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Equal Opportunity\n",
    "**Definition**: Equal true positive rates across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Among qualified people, equal chance of being predicted positive\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import recall_score\n",
    "tpr_group_a = recall_score(y_true[group_a], predictions[group_a])\n",
    "tpr_group_b = recall_score(y_true[group_b], predictions[group_b])\n",
    "# Should be similar\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Predictive Parity\n",
    "**Definition**: Equal precision across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Among those predicted positive, equal accuracy\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import precision_score\n",
    "precision_a = precision_score(y_true[group_a], predictions[group_a])\n",
    "precision_b = precision_score(y_true[group_b], predictions[group_b])\n",
    "# Should be similar\n",

    "## Part 5: Responsible Data Use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dual Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Research can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- Facial recognition: Could help find missing persons OR enable mass surveillance\n",
    "- Natural language generation: Could help write OR create misinformation at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do**:\n",
    "- Consider potential misuse\n",
    "- Implement safeguards\n",
    "- Be transparent about limitations\n",
    "- Sometimes: Don't publish certain details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of sharing**:\n",
    "- Reproducibility\n",
    "- Enables others to build on your work\n",
    "- Scientific progress\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks**:\n",
    "- Privacy violations\n",
    "- Misuse\n",
    "- Re-identification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Share when safe and beneficial\n",
    "✅ Anonymize thoroughly\n",
    "✅ Use data use agreements\n",
    "✅ Provide clear documentation\n",
    "✅ Consider tiered access\n",
    "❌ Don't share sensitive raw data publicly\n",
    "❌ Don't share without permission\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: People affected by algorithms deserve to understand them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Levels of transparency**:\n",
    "1. **Black box**: No information\n",
    "2. **Model transparency**: Share model type, features\n",
    "3. **Process transparency**: Explain how decisions are made\n",
    "4. **Individual transparency**: Explain specific predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Credit scoring\n",
    "- **Bad**: \"Computer says no\" (no explanation)\n",
    "- **Better**: \"Denied due to high debt-to-income ratio\"\n",
    "- **Best**: \"Denied. Reducing debt by $X would likely change outcome\""
