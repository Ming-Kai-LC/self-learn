    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **literature review** is a comprehensive survey of existing research on a specific topic. It's like creating a map of what is already known before you venture into unknown territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do Literature Reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Analogy\n",
    "Imagine you want to open a coffee shop:\n",
    "- ❌ **Bad approach**: Just open it without research\n",
    "- ✅ **Good approach**: Study existing coffee shops, customer preferences, successful strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in research:\n",
    "- ❌ **Bad approach**: Jump straight into experiments\n",
    "- ✅ **Good approach**: Review what others have discovered first\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Reinventing the Wheel**\n",
    "   - Someone may have already solved your problem\n",
    "   - Build on their work instead of starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learn from Others' Mistakes**\n",
    "   - See what didn't work and why\n",
    "   - Avoid common pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identify Research Gaps**\n",
    "   - Find what hasn't been studied yet\n",
    "   - Discover opportunities for original contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand Context**\n",
    "   - See how your work fits into the bigger picture\n",
    "   - Connect different research streams\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Build Credibility**\n",
    "   - Show you understand the field\n",
    "   - Demonstrate thorough preparation"

    "\n",
    "### DO:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Start with review papers**\n",
    "   - Get the lay of the land first\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Be systematic**\n",
    "   - Document your search strategy\n",
    "   - Keep track of what you've read\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Read critically**\n",
    "   - Question assumptions\n",
    "   - Look for limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Follow citation trails**\n",
    "   - Check references in good papers\n",
    "   - Look for papers that cite important work\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Take notes as you read**\n",
    "   - You won't remember everything\n",
    "   - Note key points, questions, ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Update regularly**\n",
    "   - New papers are published constantly\n",
    "   - Set up alerts for your topic\n",
    "\n",
    "### DON'T:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Read everything in full detail**\n",
    "   - Use the 3-pass approach\n",
    "   - Be selective with Pass 3\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Only read papers that agree with you**\n",
    "   - Confirmation bias is real\n",
    "   - Seek contradictory evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Ignore older papers**\n",
    "   - Foundational work is important\n",
    "   - Classic papers are classics for a reason\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Trust everything you read**\n",
    "   - Even peer-reviewed papers can be wrong\n",
    "   - Look for replication studies\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Work in isolation**\n",
    "   - Discuss papers with colleagues\n",
    "   - Join reading groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting too broad**\n",
    "   - ❌ \"Machine learning in healthcare\"\n",
    "   - ✅ \"Deep learning for diabetic retinopathy detection\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not setting boundaries**\n",
    "   - Define scope: time range, paper types, quality threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plagiarizing**\n",
    "   - Always paraphrase and cite\n",
    "   - Use quotation marks for direct quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Summarizing without synthesizing**\n",
    "   - Don't just list papers\n",
    "   - Show connections and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stopping too early**\n",
    "   - Keep reading until you see repetition\n",
