# Tools and Foundations

Essential development tools and environments for data science work.

## Overview

These projects cover the fundamental tools that every data scientist needs to master before diving into actual data science work. While not directly related to ML or statistics, proficiency with these tools dramatically increases productivity and enables professional-grade work.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **python-fundamentals** (~60 hours)
   - Python programming basics
   - Data structures and algorithms
   - Object-oriented programming
   - Best practices and PEP 8

2. **jupyter-notebook-mastery** (~4 hours)
   - Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab
   - Interactive computing
   - Notebook best practices
   - Extensions and productivity tips

3. **vscode-mastery** (~5 hours)
   - VS Code setup and configuration
   - Python extensions
   - Debugging and testing
   - Git integration

4. **github-learning** (~5 hours)
   - Version control with Git
   - GitHub workflows
   - Collaboration and pull requests
   - Branch strategies

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. python-fundamentals (if Python knowledge is incomplete)
2. vscode-mastery
3. github-learning
4. jupyter-notebook-mastery

**Time investment:** 1-2 weeks full-time (or skip if already proficient)

## Prerequisites

- None - this is the starting point
- Basic computer literacy

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Write clean, professional Python code
- Use version control effectively
- Work efficiently in VS Code and Jupyter
- Manage code repositories on GitHub
- Be ready to focus on data science content

## Next Steps

Proceed to:
- **01_mathematics** - Mathematical foundations
- **02_data_manipulation** - Data handling with Python

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)
- These are prerequisite skills mentioned in the roadmap
- TAR UMT students already have Python knowledge and can accelerate through this
