    "## 1. What is a Pull Request?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Pull Request (PR)** is a request to merge code from one branch into another. It's called a \"pull\" request because you're asking the project maintainer to \"pull\" your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Your Feature Branch                Main Branch\n",
    "      |                                |\n",
    "  A - B - C              PR Request    A - D\n",
    "               ========================>\n",
    "                     After Review\n",
    "               ========================>\n",
    "                                       A - D - M (merge)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Pull Requests?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Code Review**: Others can review your code before merging\n",
    "- **Discussion**: Team can discuss changes and suggest improvements\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Catch bugs and issues before they reach main\n",
    "- **Documentation**: PRs serve as documentation for why changes were made\n",
    "- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests run before merging\n",
    "- **Learning**: Reviewers can learn from your code, you can learn from feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Request vs Direct Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Direct Merge** (Not Recommended):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git switch main\n",

    "Before:                    After:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Before Creating a PR\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep PRs small**: Easier to review, faster to merge\n",
    "2. **One feature per PR**: Don't mix unrelated changes\n",
    "3. **Test thoroughly**: All tests should pass\n",
    "4. **Update from main**: Rebase or merge main into your branch first\n",
    "5. **Self-review**: Review your own code before submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### PR Description Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear title**: Describe what the PR does\n",
    "2. **Comprehensive summary**: Explain the why, not just the what\n",
    "3. **List changes**: Bullet points of modifications\n",
    "4. **Link issues**: Reference related issues/tickets\n",
    "5. **Add context**: Screenshots, examples, or documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### During Review\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Respond promptly**: Address feedback quickly\n",
    "2. **Be open to suggestions**: Reviews improve code quality\n",
    "3. **Explain decisions**: If you disagree, explain why professionally\n",
    "4. **Update and test**: After changes, verify everything still works\n",
    "5. **Mark resolved**: Use GitHub's conversation resolution feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### After Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Delete feature branch**: Keep repository clean\n",
    "2. **Update local repository**: Pull the changes\n",
    "3. **Close related issues**: If applicable\n",
    "4. **Thank reviewers**: Acknowledge their time and feedback\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: PRs That Are Too Large\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: 500+ lines changed, multiple features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Break into smaller PRs\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ One PR: \"Add user system\"\n",
    "✅ Multiple PRs:\n",
    "   - \"Add user model and database schema\"\n",
    "   - \"Add user authentication endpoints\"\n",
    "   - \"Add user profile UI\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Vague PR Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: \"Fixed stuff\" or \"Updates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Be specific\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ \"Fixed bug\"\n",
    "✅ \"Fix null pointer exception in user login when email is not verified\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Not Testing Before Submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: PR breaks tests or has obvious bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Always run tests locally\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Before creating PR\n",
    "npm test  # or pytest, cargo test, etc.\n",
    "npm run lint\n",
    "npm run build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 4: Getting Defensive About Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: \"My code is fine\" attitude\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Remember code review is about code quality, not personal criticism\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ \"This is how I always do it\"\n",
    "✅ \"I see your point. Let me refactor this to be clearer.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 5: Not Keeping PRs Updated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: PR becomes outdated while waiting for review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Regularly update from main\n",
    "```bash\n",
