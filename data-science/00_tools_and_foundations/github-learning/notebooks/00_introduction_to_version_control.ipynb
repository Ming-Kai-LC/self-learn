    "\n",
    "### A Common Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're working on a data analysis project. Over time, your folder might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "📁 my_analysis/\n",
    "├── analysis.py\n",
    "├── analysis_v2.py\n",
    "├── analysis_v2_final.py\n",

    "├── analysis_working.py\n",
    "└── analysis_DO_NOT_USE.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with this approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confusion**: Which file is the current version?\n",
    "2. **Lost History**: What changed between versions? Why?\n",
    "3. **Storage Waste**: Lots of duplicate code\n",
    "4. **Collaboration Nightmare**: How do multiple people work on this?\n",
    "5. **No Recovery**: Hard to undo mistakes or recover old code\n",
    "6. **Fear of Change**: Afraid to experiment because you might break something\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Horror Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story 1: The Lost Feature**\n",
    "> A developer spent 2 weeks building a feature, then accidentally deleted the file. No backup existed. The feature had to be rebuilt from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story 2: The Merge Disaster**\n",
    "> Three team members edited the same file. They tried to manually combine changes by copy-pasting. The result? None of the code worked, and they couldn't figure out what broke.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story 3: The Mystery Bug**\n",
    "> A bug appeared in production. No one knew when it was introduced or what caused it. The team had to review weeks of code changes manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems **solve all these problems**."

    "**Version Control System (VCS)** is software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.\n",

    "v1.0          v1.1           v1.2          v2.0\n",

    "  │             │              │             │\n",
    "Initial      Added         Fixed         New\n",
    "version      feature       bug           design\n",
    "\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "- See what changed at each point ✓\n",
    "- Go back to any version ✓\n",
    "- Know who made each change ✓\n",
    "- Understand why changes were made ✓\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Version Control Tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Who**: Which person made the change\n",
    "- **What**: Which files and lines changed\n",
    "- **When**: Exact timestamp of changes\n",
    "- **Why**: Description of why the change was made (commit message)\n",
    "- **Where**: Which branch or version of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete History**: Every change is recorded with context\n",
    "2. **Undo Capability**: Safely revert bad changes\n",
    "3. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work simultaneously\n",
    "4. **Branching**: Experiment without affecting the main code\n",
    "5. **Backup**: Your code is stored in multiple places\n",
    "6. **Accountability**: Know who changed what and when\n",
    "7. **Documentation**: Commit messages explain the evolution of your project"

    "### Why Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was created to manage Linux kernel development (millions of lines of code, thousands of contributors).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Free and Open Source**: No cost, available to everyone\n",
    "2. **Distributed**: Every developer has full history\n",
    "3. **Fast**: Operations are local and optimized\n",
    "4. **Branching**: Create parallel versions effortlessly\n",
    "5. **Data Integrity**: Uses checksums to prevent corruption\n",
    "6. **Non-Linear Development**: Support for complex workflows\n",
    "7. **Industry Standard**: Used by 90%+ of developers worldwide\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Statistics (2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **100+ million** developers use Git globally\n",
    "- **90%** of job postings require Git knowledge\n",
    "- Powers **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket** and more\n",
    "- Used by **Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix**, virtually every tech company\n",

    "❌ Git is **not** a backup system (though it helps)\n",
    "❌ Git is **not** only for code (can track any text files)\n",

    "- Works **completely offline**\n",
    "- Is a **command-line tool**\n",
    "- Is **free and open source**\n",

    "**Analogy**: Git is like Microsoft Word's \"Track Changes\" feature, but much more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub (The Platform)\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a web-based hosting service that:\n",
    "- **Stores** your Git repositories in the cloud\n",
    "- Enables **collaboration** with other developers\n",
    "- Provides a **web interface** for Git\n",
    "- Adds **extra features** (Issues, Pull Requests, Actions, etc.)\n",
    "- Is **owned by Microsoft** (acquired 2018 for $7.5 billion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: GitHub is like Google Drive or Dropbox, but specifically designed for code with Git integration.\n",
