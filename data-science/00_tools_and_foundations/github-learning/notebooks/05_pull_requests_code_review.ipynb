    "### Three Ways to Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Merge Commit (Default)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before:                After:\n",
    "main    ●──●──●       main    ●──●──●──M\n",

    "feature   ●──●    →  feature   ●──●──╯\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Preserves complete history\n",
    "- ✅ Shows feature branch structure\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to revert entire feature\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Cluttered history with many PRs\n",
    "- ❌ Merge commits add noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Want to preserve feature branch history\n",
    "- Need to track feature as a unit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Squash and Merge\n",

    "feature   ●──●──●  →   (single commit)   ╲\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Clean, linear history\n",
    "- ✅ One commit per feature\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to understand main branch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Loses granular commit history\n",
    "- ❌ Can't cherry-pick individual commits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Want clean main branch history\n",

    "- ✅ Preserves individual commits\n",
    "- ✅ Clean and readable\n",

    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Rewrites history (changes commit SHAs)\n",
