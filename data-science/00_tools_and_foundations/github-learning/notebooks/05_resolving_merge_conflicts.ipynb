    "### The Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A **merge conflict** occurs when Git can't automatically determine which changes should take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Main Branch                Feature Branch\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    A\n",
    "    |\n",

    "    |         │            |\n",
    "    C (file.txt line 1:    D (file.txt line 1:\n",
    "       \"Hello World\")         \"Greetings Earth\")\n",
    "    |         │            |\n",
    "    ↓         └──merge────→ CONFLICT!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Git says: \"Both branches modified the same line. You decide!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Conflicts Happen\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts occur when:\n",
    "1. **Same line edited**: Two branches modify the same line differently\n",
    "2. **File deleted vs modified**: One branch deletes a file, another modifies it\n",
    "3. **File renamed**: One branch renames a file, another modifies original\n",
    "4. **Different line endings**: Windows (CRLF) vs Unix (LF) conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Conflicts Are Detected\n",
    "\n",
    "- During `git merge`\n",
    "- During `git rebase`\n",
    "- During `git pull` (which includes merge)\n",
    "- During `git cherry-pick`\n",

    "## 8. Preventing Merge Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pull frequently**: Stay in sync with main branch\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git switch main\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "git switch feature-branch\n",
    "git merge main  # or: git rebase main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make small, focused commits**: Easier to resolve conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Communicate with team**: Let others know what files you're working on\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use feature branches**: Keep work isolated\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Don't edit the same files simultaneously**: Coordinate with team\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use .gitattributes for merge strategies**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# .gitattributes\n",
    "*.json merge=union  # Combine changes\n",
    "*.md merge=union    # Combine markdown changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good**: Modular, separate files\n",
    "```\n",
    "src/\n",
    "  user.py\n",
    "  payment.py\n",
    "  shipping.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each developer works on different files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad**: Everything in one file\n",
    "```\n",
    "src/\n",
    "  main.py  # 5000 lines!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Everyone edits the same file → more conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use GitHub Issues/Projects**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Issue #42: \"Refactoring authentication module\"\n",
    "Assignee: Alice\n",
    "Status: In Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Bob knows not to edit auth files\n",

    "### When a Conflict Occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't panic!** Conflicts are normal and fixable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check status**: `git status` shows conflicted files\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Understand the conflict**: Look at both versions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choose resolution strategy**:\n",
    "   - Manual edit (most common)\n",
    "   - Accept ours (`--ours`)\n",
    "   - Accept theirs (`--theirs`)\n",
    "   - Use merge tool\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resolve each file**: Remove conflict markers\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test the code**: Make sure it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Stage resolved files**: `git add <file>`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Complete merge**: `git commit`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Push if needed**: `git push`\n",
