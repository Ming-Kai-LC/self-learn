## Tips for Success

### Best Practices

1. **Practice Daily**: Even 30 minutes a day beats one long weekly session
2. **Use Real Projects**: Apply Git to your other coding projects
3. **Read Commit Messages**: Study how open source projects write commits
4. **Join Communities**: Participate in discussions on GitHub
5. **Contribute to Open Source**: Start with documentation, then code
6. **Build Your Profile**: Treat your GitHub as a portfolio
7. **Don't Fear Mistakes**: You can almost always recover in Git
8. **Ask Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions, Stack Overflow, or Reddit

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Skipping fundamentals**: Don't jump to advanced topics too quickly
- **Not practicing**: Reading isn't enough; you must do
- **Poor commit messages**: Practice writing clear, descriptive messages
- **Committing too infrequently**: Commit small, logical changes often
- **Ignoring conflicts**: Learn to resolve them properly, don't force-push
- **Not backing up**: Push your work to GitHub regularly
- **Giving up on errors**: Errors are learning opportunities

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Git command not found**
A: Ensure Git is installed and added to your PATH. Restart your terminal after installation.

**Q: Permission denied (publickey)**
A: Set up SSH keys correctly. See Module 0 for detailed instructions.

**Q: Merge conflict nightmare**
A: Don't panic! Module 3 covers conflict resolution step-by-step.

**Q: Accidentally committed sensitive data**
A: Never push it! See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for recovery steps.

**Q: Jupyter notebook won't start**
A: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.

**Q: Can't push to GitHub**
A: Check your remote URL (`git remote -v`) and authentication method.

For more detailed troubleshooting, see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
