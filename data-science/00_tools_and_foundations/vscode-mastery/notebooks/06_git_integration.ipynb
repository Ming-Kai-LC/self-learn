    "\n",
    "### Commit Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commit often, but logically:**\n",
    "- Make a commit when you complete a small, working piece of functionality\n",
    "- Don't wait until end of day with 50 changes\n",
    "- Don't commit every keystroke\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good commit sizes:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "✓ \"Add login form validation\"\n",
    "✓ \"Fix navbar alignment bug\"\n",
    "✓ \"Update API endpoint for users\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Too large:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "✗ \"Add entire authentication system, refactor database, update all pages, fix 10 bugs\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review Before Committing\n",
    "\n",
    "Always check your diffs before committing:\n",
    "1. Click each changed file\n",
    "2. Review the diff\n",
    "3. Look for:\n",
    "   - Debug code you forgot to remove\n",
    "   - Commented-out code\n",
    "   - Accidental changes\n",
    "   - Console.log or print statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `.gitignore` to exclude files from Git:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "*.pyc\n",
    "__pycache__/\n",
    "venv/\n",
    ".env\n",
    "\n",
    "# Node.js\n",
    "node_modules/\n",
    "package-lock.json\n",

    "# OS\n",
    ".DS_Store\n",
    "Thumbs.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple workflow for solo projects:**\n",
    "- `main` branch: Stable, working code\n",
    "- Feature branches: One per feature/fix\n",
    "- Merge to main when complete\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team workflow:**\n",
    "- `main`: Production-ready code\n",
    "- `develop`: Integration branch\n",
    "- `feature/*`: New features\n",
    "- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes\n",
    "- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sync Regularly\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with others:\n",
    "- **Pull before starting work** each day\n",
    "- **Pull before pushing** your commits\n",
    "- **Resolve conflicts early** before they grow\n",
    "- **Communicate** when working on same files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep Commits Focused\n",
    "\n",
    "One commit should address one concern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "✓ Separate commits:\n",
    "  - \"Add user registration form\"\n",
    "  - \"Fix typo in homepage header\"\n",
    "  - \"Update dependencies\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✗ Combined commit:\n",
    "  - \"Add registration, fix typo, update deps\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes it easier to:\n",
    "- Understand history\n",
    "- Revert specific changes\n",
    "- Review code"
