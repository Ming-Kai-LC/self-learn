# Mathematics for Data Science

Mathematical foundations that underpin all machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Mathematics is the non-negotiable foundation that distinguishes mediocre data scientists from exceptional ones."**

This domain covers statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus - the essential mathematical concepts needed to truly understand machine learning rather than just applying it mechanically.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **mathematics-for-data-science** (60-80 hours) 🚧 *Placeholder*
   - Statistics and probability fundamentals
   - Linear algebra for ML
   - Calculus basics for optimization
   - Mathematical intuition for algorithms

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. Complete mathematics-for-data-science modules sequentially
2. Spend 4-6 months building strong foundations
3. Don't rush - these concepts underpin everything

**Time investment:** 4-6 months at 10-15 hours per week

## Prerequisites

- Basic arithmetic and algebra
- **python-fundamentals** (to implement mathematical concepts in code)

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Understand descriptive and inferential statistics
- Work confidently with probability distributions
- Apply linear algebra concepts (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Grasp gradient descent and optimization
- Read research papers and understand mathematical notation
- Explain why algorithms work, not just how to use them

## Next Steps

Proceed to:
- **02_data_manipulation** - Apply math to real data
- **05_machine_learning** - Use mathematical foundations in ML

## Key Learning Resources

- Khan Academy (Statistics, Linear Algebra) - FREE
- 3Blue1Brown (Visual intuitions) - FREE
- DeepLearning.AI courses (Math for ML) - $49/month
- "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists" book

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)
- Allocate 4-6 months to master these concepts
- This is your competitive advantage over "certificate collectors"
- TAR UMT coursework should complement self-study here
