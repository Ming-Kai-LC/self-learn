# Mathematics for Data Science

Mathematical foundations that underpin all machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Mathematics is the non-negotiable foundation that distinguishes mediocre data scientists from exceptional ones."**

This domain covers statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus - the essential mathematical concepts needed to truly understand machine learning rather than just applying it mechanically.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **mathematics-for-data-science** (~10-12 hours) ✅ *Complete*
   - **8 comprehensive modules** covering all essential mathematics
   - **Module 00**: Setup and mathematical computing with NumPy, SciPy, SymPy
   - **Module 01**: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, distributions)
   - **Module 02**: Probability fundamentals (Bayes' theorem, distributions, expected values)
   - **Module 03**: Statistical inference (CLT, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
   - **Module 04**: Linear algebra foundations (vectors, matrices, linear systems)
   - **Module 05**: Linear algebra for ML (PCA, SVD, eigenvalues)
   - **Module 06**: Calculus basics (derivatives, gradient descent, optimization)
   - **Module 07**: Final project (breast cancer classification from scratch)
   - **25+ exercises** with detailed solutions
   - **Professional visualizations** and real-world applications

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. Start with Module 00 (Setup and Introduction)
2. Complete Modules 01-03 (Statistics and Probability) - foundational
3. Progress through Modules 04-05 (Linear Algebra) - essential for ML
4. Study Module 06 (Calculus) - for optimization
5. Complete Module 07 (Final Project) - integrate all concepts

**Time investment:**
- **Intensive**: 1-2 weeks at 6-8 hours per day
- **Moderate**: 2-4 weeks at 2-3 hours per day
- **Relaxed**: 4-6 weeks at 1-2 hours per day

**Note**: While the course content is 10-12 hours, allocate additional time for:
- Practicing exercises and reviewing solutions
- Exploring supplementary resources (Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown)
- Building strong foundations - don't rush these concepts

## Prerequisites

- Basic arithmetic and algebra
- **python-fundamentals** (to implement mathematical concepts in code)

## What You'll Achieve

After completing this project, you will be able to:
- **Statistics**: Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics, understand distributions, detect outliers
- **Probability**: Apply Bayes' theorem, work with binomial/normal/Poisson distributions, calculate expected values
- **Statistical Inference**: Understand the Central Limit Theorem, construct confidence intervals, perform hypothesis testing
- **Linear Algebra**: Manipulate vectors and matrices, understand eigenvalues/eigenvectors, apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
- **Calculus**: Compute derivatives and gradients, understand optimization, implement gradient descent from scratch
- **Integration**: Build a complete ML classifier using mathematical foundations (Module 07)
- **Read research papers** and understand mathematical notation fluently
- **Explain WHY algorithms work**, not just how to use them

## Key Features

✨ **What Makes This Course Special:**

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Starts with beginner-friendly concepts, builds to advanced topics
- **Real-World Applications**: Medical testing, IQ scores, factory quality control, sports analytics
- **Simulation Verification**: Theoretical results verified with Monte Carlo simulations
