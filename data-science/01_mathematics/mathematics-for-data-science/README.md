   - Perform hypothesis testing and understand p-values
   - Calculate confidence intervals

2. **Linear Algebra**
   - Understand vectors, matrices, and tensors
   - Perform matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, inverse)
   - Understand eigenvalues and eigenvectors
   - Apply linear transformations
   - Grasp the concepts behind PCA and SVD

3. **Calculus**
