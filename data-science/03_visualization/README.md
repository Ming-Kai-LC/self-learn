# Data Visualization

Transform data analysis into compelling visual insights.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Data visualization transforms analysis into insight."** and **"Storytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic is mandatory reading—it teaches you to communicate data insights compellingly, a skill that distinguishes employable data scientists."**

This domain teaches you to create effective visualizations and communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **data-visualization-fundamentals** (8-12 hours)
   - Matplotlib for customizable plots
   - Seaborn for statistical graphics
   - Plotly for interactive visualizations
   - Design principles and best practices
   - Storytelling with data

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. Complete data-visualization-fundamentals
2. Apply visualization skills to every future project
3. Read "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic

**Time investment:** 3-4 weeks

## Prerequisites

- **data-science-fundamentals** (Pandas for data manipulation)
- **mathematics-for-data-science** (statistics for understanding distributions)

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Create publication-quality visualizations
- Choose appropriate chart types for different data
- Design effective dashboards
- Tell compelling stories with data
- Present insights to non-technical stakeholders
- Use color, labels, and annotations effectively
- Build interactive visualizations

## Key Visualization Types

- **Distributions**: Histograms, KDE plots, box plots, violin plots
- **Relationships**: Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots
- **Comparisons**: Bar charts, grouped bars, small multiples
- **Time series**: Line charts, area charts, seasonal plots
- **Geospatial**: Maps, choropleth, bubble maps
- **Hierarchical**: Treemaps, sunburst charts

## Next Steps

Proceed to:
- **05_machine_learning** - Visualize model performance
- **04_data_engineering** - Dashboard and reporting pipelines
- Apply visualization to all portfolio projects

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Foundation Phase (Months 1-3)
- Dedicate 3-4 weeks to mastering visualization libraries
- "Storytelling with Data" is mandatory reading
- Communication skills are equally important as technical capabilities
- Data storytelling separates junior from senior data scientists
