# Data Engineering

Build robust data pipelines and streaming systems.

## Overview

Data engineering provides the infrastructure that makes data science possible. This domain covers ETL pipelines, data quality, and real-time data processing - skills that bridge the gap between raw data sources and analysis-ready datasets.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **data-engineering-fundamentals** (8-10 hours)
   - ETL pipeline design
   - Data quality and validation
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Database integration
   - Automation and scheduling

2. **data-engineering-streaming** (7-8 hours) ✅ *Core modules complete*
   - Real-time data processing
   - Apache Kafka fundamentals
   - Stream processing with Flink
   - Event-driven architectures
   - Stateful stream processing
   - *Future: Advanced patterns (CDC, monitoring, capstone)*

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. data-engineering-fundamentals (batch processing)
2. data-engineering-streaming (real-time processing)

**Time investment:**
- Current content: 15-18 hours (both projects)
- With planned streaming modules: 18-22 hours

## Prerequisites

- **sql-fundamentals** (database operations)
- **data-science-fundamentals** (Python data manipulation)
- **python-fundamentals** (scripting and automation)

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Design and build ETL pipelines
- Ensure data quality and validation
- Process streaming data in real-time
- Use Kafka for message queuing
- Apply stream processing with Flink
- Schedule and monitor data workflows
- Handle data at scale

## Key Technologies

- **Batch Processing**: Pandas, SQL, scheduling (Airflow/cron)
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink
- **Data Quality**: Great Expectations, data validation
- **Orchestration**: Workflow management

## Next Steps

Proceed to:
- **08_big_data** - Scale to massive datasets with Spark
- **09_mlops_deployment** - ML pipeline orchestration
- **05_machine_learning** - Build features from engineered data

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Intermediate to Advanced
- Data engineering fundamentals support ML workflows
- Streaming covered in Advanced Phase (Months 12-18)
- Kafka and Flink are production-critical skills
- Complements cloud platforms for scalable data infrastructure

## Career Note

Data engineering skills make you more valuable:
- **38.7%** of data engineer roles require Spark
- **74.5%** need Azure, **49.5%** need AWS
- Growing demand for hybrid data scientist/engineer roles
- Higher compensation for candidates with both DS and DE skills
