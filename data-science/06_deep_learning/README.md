# Deep Learning

Neural networks, transformers, and modern deep learning.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"Learn PyTorch first—it dominates research (85% of papers), offers more intuitive Python-like programming, and provides easier debugging."** Deep learning mentions doubled to **20% of job postings**, with NLP jumping from 5% to **19% between 2023-2024**.

GenAI and LLMs are transforming the field, with **45% of IT budgets now allocated to GenAI**.
