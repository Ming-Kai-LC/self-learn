Understand extractive vs generative QA\n2. Implement BERT-based QA systems\n3. Use SQuAD dataset\n4. Build end-to-end QA pipeline\n5. Evaluate with EM and F1 metrics\n\n## Question Answering\n\n### Extractive QA:\n- Answer is span from context\n- Predict start and end positions\n- Example: SQuAD, TriviaQA\n\n### Generative QA:\n- Generate answer from scratch\n- Uses seq2seq models\n- Example: MS MARCO, ELI5"
