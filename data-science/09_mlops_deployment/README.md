# MLOps and Deployment

Production machine learning and deployment infrastructure.

## Overview

According to the DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md: **"MLOps expertise makes you invaluable. Only 30% of ML models ever reach production"** and **"MLOps and deployment skills separate academic data scientists from industry professionals."**

Cloud platform expertise is now **mandatory, not optional—about 20% of data science job listings explicitly require cloud certifications**.

## Projects in This Domain

1. **mlops-deployment** (60-80 hours) 🚧 *Placeholder*
   - Docker containerization for ML
   - Kubernetes orchestration basics
   - MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Model serving with FastAPI/Flask
   - CI/CD pipelines for ML
   - Monitoring and model drift detection

2. **cloud-platforms** (60-80 hours per platform) 🚧 *Placeholder*
   - AWS for ML (SageMaker, Lambda, EMR)
   - Azure ML (Azure ML Studio, Databricks)
   - Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, BigQuery ML)
   - Cloud certifications preparation

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. mlops-deployment (Docker, MLflow, APIs, CI/CD)
2. cloud-platforms (choose primary: AWS, Azure, or GCP)
3. Apply MLOps to all future projects

**Time investment:** 6-12 months (Advanced phase)

## Prerequisites

- **machine-learning-fundamentals** (ML model building)
- **deep-learning-fundamentals** (optional, for DL deployment)
- **python-fundamentals** (scripting and automation)
- Basic command-line and Git knowledge

## What You'll Achieve

After completing these projects, you will:
- Containerize ML applications with Docker
- Deploy models as REST APIs
- Track experiments with MLflow
- Set up CI/CD for ML pipelines
- Monitor models in production
- Deploy to AWS, Azure, or GCP
- Pass cloud ML certifications
- Build production-grade ML systems

## Key Technologies

**Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
**Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases
**Model Serving**: FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
**Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, model drift detection
**Cloud**: AWS (SageMaker), Azure (ML), GCP (Vertex AI)

## Cloud Platform Choice (Malaysian Market)

Based on roadmap analysis:
1. **Primary**: Azure (enterprise adoption, Microsoft presence)
2. **Secondary**: AWS (startups, tech companies like Grab, Shopee)
3. **Optional**: GCP (cutting-edge ML, specific companies)

## Certification Paths

**AWS Certified ML Specialty**: $300, 27% of jobs mention AWS
**Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100)**: $165, growing demand
**Google Professional ML Engineer**: $200, highest salaries

## Next Steps

Proceed to:
- Apply MLOps to **11_portfolio_projects**
- Build production ML system as portfolio showcase
- Pursue cloud certification
- Explore multi-cloud strategies

## Roadmap Alignment

**DataScience_SelfLearnPath.md**: Advanced Phase (Months 10-12)
- MLOps separates junior from senior practitioners
- Cloud skills: 20% explicitly require, most expect competency
- Part of MLOps Engineer track (7-12 months)
- Essential for production deployment

## Industry Relevance

- **Only 30%** of ML models reach production (MLOps fixes this)
- **20%** of jobs explicitly require cloud certifications
- Higher compensation for deployment skills
- Critical differentiator in hiring decisions
- Production experience > academic knowledge

## Learning Resources

- **MLflow documentation**: Experiment tracking and model registry
- **Docker tutorials**: Containerization fundamentals
- **Kubernetes docs**: Orchestration (increasingly common)
- **Cloud provider documentation**: AWS/Azure/GCP specific guides
- **"Designing Machine Learning Systems"** by Chip Huyen
