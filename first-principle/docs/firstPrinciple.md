# How Elon Musk Thinks from Scratch

Elon Musk has built multiple billion-dollar companies by consistently applying a 2,000-year-old reasoning methodology that most people ignore: **first principles thinking**. Rather than accepting industry conventions, he breaks problems down to their most fundamental truths and rebuilds solutions from scratch—achieving cost reductions of 40-99% across aerospace, automotive, and infrastructure industries. His companies have demonstrated that questioning basic assumptions and reasoning from physical fundamentals produces not incremental improvements but order-of-magnitude transformations: SpaceX reduced launch costs by 76%, Tesla cut battery costs by 56%, and Boring Company slashed tunnel costs by 90-99%. This approach has reshaped entire industries by revealing that most "inevitable" costs are actually inefficient conventions rather than physical constraints.

## The ancient philosophy powering modern innovation

First principles thinking originated over 2,000 years ago with Aristotle, who defined a first principle as "the first basis from which a thing is known"—a basic proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle argued for seeking "the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements" in systematic inquiry. The methodology requires **decomposing complex problems into their most basic, foundational elements that cannot be reduced further**, then reasoning upward from those fundamentals to construct new solutions.

This stands in stark contrast to analogical reasoning, which dominates how most people think. Analogical reasoning compares new situations to existing examples, applying prior solutions with modifications—essentially copying what others do with slight variations. It's mentally efficient and works well for routine problems, but it traps innovation within existing paradigms. First principles thinking demands more mental energy but enables breakthrough solutions by questioning every assumption about how things "should" work.

René Descartes later developed this into systematic doubt, doubting everything until reaching purely indubitable truths. His famous "Cogito ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am") exemplified identifying a foundational truth from which all other knowledge could be built. In mathematics, Euclid's Elements demonstrated this approach perfectly: from a handful of definitions, postulates, and self-evident axioms, hundreds of geometric propositions could be deduced. **The laws of thermodynamics serve as first principles in physics—energy cannot be created or destroyed, entropy always increases—foundational truths that cannot be proven from more basic physics but underpin all understanding of energy and heat.**

## Musk's physics framework for business problems

Musk articulated his approach most clearly in his 2013 TED Talk: "I do think there's a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are—what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy." He emphasized that while humans naturally reason by analogy to get through daily life efficiently, innovation requires abandoning this comfortable pattern.

In a 2012 interview with Kevin Rose, Musk explained his three-step process. **First, identify the conventional wisdom or assumption—what "everyone knows" to be true based on historical precedent.** For batteries, this was: "Battery packs are really expensive and that's just the way they will always be. Historically, it has cost $600 per kilowatt hour. It's not going to be much better than that in the future." For rockets: "Historically, all rockets have been expensive, so therefore, in the future, all rockets will be expensive."

**Second, break down to fundamental truths or material constituents.** Musk described this as asking: "What are the material constituents of the batteries? What is the stock market value of the material constituents?" For batteries, this meant cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers for separation, and a steel can. When he checked London Metal Exchange prices, the raw materials cost only $80 per kilowatt hour—nearly 8X less than the industry price. For rockets, aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, titanium, copper, and carbon fiber comprised only about 2% of typical rocket prices when valued at commodity market rates.

**Third, reason upward from those truths to create new solutions.** As Musk explained: "So clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes." This step requires determining "if there's some catch here that I'm not appreciating" and testing whether the conclusion works. Musk held Saturday meetings with aerospace engineers to identify any overlooked constraints before founding SpaceX, ultimately concluding: "There doesn't seem to be any catch."

Musk has repeatedly contrasted this with industry thinking: "I think people's thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It's rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They'll say, 'We'll do that because it's always been done that way.' Or they'll not do it because 'Well, nobody's ever done that, so it must not be good.' But that's just a ridiculous way to think." In his 2014 USC Commencement speech, he advised: "Don't just follow the trend. It's good to think in terms of the physics approach—the first principles. This is a good way to figure out if something really makes sense, or if it's just what everybody else is doing."

## The $65 million rocket that cost $1.3 million in materials

The SpaceX founding story exemplifies first principles thinking in action. In 2002, Musk wanted to send a rocket to Mars but received quotes of **$65 million per rocket from aerospace manufacturers**. Russian ICBM options cost $8-20 million but remained prohibitively expensive for his vision. Rather than accepting these prices or abandoning the idea, Musk applied physics reasoning to the problem.

He asked the fundamental question: "What is a rocket made of?" The answer was straightforward—aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. When he calculated the commodity market value of these raw materials, he discovered they cost approximately **$1.3 million, or just 2% of the typical $65 million rocket price**. This revealed that 98% of rocket costs came not from physical materials but from how the industry arranged those materials—inefficient processes, contractor markups, and accepted conventions.

Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 to attack this 98% markup through vertical integration and questioning every aerospace assumption. The results have been extraordinary. SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 for **$390-440 million including the earlier Falcon 1**, while NASA estimated developing equivalent capability through traditional contracting would cost **$4 billion—a 10X cost reduction**. Current Falcon 9 launches cost $62-67 million advertised, with internal costs around $28 million for reused boosters, compared to NASA's Space Shuttle at $1.5 billion per launch. This translates to **$2,720 per kilogram to Low Earth Orbit versus $54,500 for the Shuttle—a 20-fold reduction**.

The reusability innovation demonstrates pure first principles thinking. Musk asked why rockets cost so much when fuel represents only 0.3% of the cost. He compared rockets to airplanes: "If you had to throw away a 747 after every flight, a one-way ticket from Boston to Shanghai would cost $500,000. No one would fly." The fundamental physics didn't require disposable rockets—only industry convention did. The first stage booster costs approximately $37 million (60% of the rocket), but refurbishment costs only $1 million. SpaceX has now achieved over 500 successful booster landings, with some boosters flying 20+ times, designed for 100+ flights.

SpaceX's vertical integration strategy—manufacturing 80-85% of components in-house—emerged from first principles analysis of contractor markups. When a supplier quoted 1.5 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars for an engine valve, SpaceX made it themselves that summer. Instead of $1 million specialty aerospace computers, they used $5,000 ATM-type computers. Bathroom stall latches replaced custom hatch handles, saving $1,400+ per unit. Race car safety belts served as astronaut harnesses. This relentless questioning of "aerospace-grade" requirements enabled dramatic cost reductions while maintaining or improving reliability.

## Breaking the $600 battery barrier with commodity metals

Tesla's battery cost reduction follows the same pattern. When Musk entered the electric vehicle industry, batteries cost $600 per kilowatt hour, and conventional wisdom held this would improve only incrementally. Industry experts cited historical costs as proof that batteries would remain expensive. Musk applied his material constituents framework: batteries contain cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers, and a steel can. London Metal Exchange prices valued these materials at approximately $80 per kilowatt hour.

At Tesla's Battery Day in September 2020, the company revealed a comprehensive strategy to reduce battery costs by **56% through five integrated innovations**. Cell design improvements using the tabless 4680 format delivered 5X more energy per cell, 6X more power, and 16% range increase while cutting costs 14%. Manufacturing process innovations using dry electrode coating eliminated energy-intensive solvent processes, reducing factory footprint by 10X, energy use by 10X, and equipment investment by 86%—contributing 18% cost reduction. Switching to metallurgical-grade silicon anodes at $1.20/kWh provided 5% cost savings and 20% range increase. Cathode innovations eliminating cobalt and optimizing nickel reduced costs 12% while cutting process costs 76% and producing zero wastewater. Finally, integrating battery packs as structural vehicle components reduced mass 10%, increased range 14%, eliminated 370 parts, and contributed 7% cost reduction.

By 2020, industry analysts estimated Tesla achieved **$110-150 per kilowatt hour versus the industry average of $350/kWh**—transforming electric vehicles from luxury products to mass-market possibilities. Tesla announced plans for a $25,000 vehicle by 2023-2025, enabled entirely by questioning the fundamental assumption that batteries must be expensive because they always have been.

## Casting car parts like toys and digging tunnels faster

Tesla's Giga Press manufacturing innovation emerged from asking a childlike first principles question: "How do toy cars get made?" Toy cars are single die-cast pieces, not hundreds of stamped and welded components. Musk applied this to full-size vehicles, deploying massive 6,000-ton die-casting machines that produce the Model Y's rear underbody as **one or two large aluminum components instead of 79 separate parts**. This reduced manufacturing time from 1-2 hours to 3-5 minutes, cut 700-800 robotic weld points to approximately 50, decreased weight by 30%, and reduced rear underbody manufacturing costs by 40%. Traditional automakers insisted this was impossible at automotive scale—until Tesla proved otherwise. Toyota, General Motors, Volvo, and Volkswagen are now adopting similar technology, validating Musk's approach.

The Boring Company attacked tunnel costs with equally ruthless first principles analysis. Traditional tunneling costs $200 million to $1 billion per mile, with NYC's Second Avenue Subway at $2.5 billion per mile. Rather than accepting these costs, Musk asked why tunnels must be 26-28 feet in diameter. Traditional answers cited safety margins and conventional vehicle sizes. Musk reduced diameter to 12 feet for single-lane traffic, cutting cross-sectional excavation area by 75%. He questioned the sequential dig-then-reinforce process, implementing continuous boring with simultaneous reinforcement installation for 5X speed increase.

Results speak clearly: The **Las Vegas Convention Center Loop cost $28.6 million per mile versus $86 million/mile for the proposed monorail alternative**—67% savings. The Hawthorne test tunnel cost **$8.8 million per mile compared to $1 billion/mile for LA Metro**—a 99% cost reduction. While Boring Company faces scaling challenges, the magnitude of improvement demonstrates what questioning fundamental assumptions can achieve. As Musk noted, Gary the snail moves 14X faster than traditional boring machines—an absurd benchmark that motivated radical rethinking.

## The three-question framework anyone can use

First principles thinking requires structured discipline. Based on Musk's methodology across multiple companies, individuals can apply this framework to their own challenges:

**Question one: What is the conventional wisdom?** Write down explicitly what "everyone knows" about the problem. This might be industry pricing, accepted timelines, standard approaches, or historical precedents. Be specific—"batteries cost $600/kWh" or "rockets cost $65 million" rather than vague statements. Identify the analogies being used: "We do it this way because that's how Company X does it" or "Nobody has succeeded at this before, so it must be impossible."

**Question two: What are the fundamental truths?** Strip away everything that's merely conventional to reach physical, mathematical, or logical fundamentals. For physical products, ask what raw materials comprise the item and what those materials cost at commodity prices. For processes, identify the actual physical constraints versus organizational habits. For services, determine the irreducible requirements versus added complexities. Use the "Five Whys" technique—repeatedly asking "why" to drill past surface explanations to root causes. Challenge yourself: "What am I absolutely certain is true?" versus "What am I assuming based on what others do?"

**Question three: What new solution can be built from these fundamentals?** Reason upward from first principles without being constrained by existing approaches. This requires asking: "If I were designing this from scratch knowing only the fundamental truths, what would I create?" Test whether your reasoning holds: discuss with domain experts to identify potential catches, but don't let expertise in how things are currently done override physics or mathematics about how things could be done. Iterate based on data and feedback, maintaining willingness to be wrong about specific implementations while staying anchored to verified fundamentals.

Musk's semantic tree framework applies to learning itself. In his 2015 Reddit AMA, he advised: "It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to." Master foundational concepts in any domain before diving into specifics. In physics, understand Newton's laws before quantum mechanics. In business, grasp unit economics before growth strategies. In programming, comprehend algorithms and data structures before frameworks.

Recognize that first principles thinking demands significantly more mental energy than analogical reasoning. Musk acknowledged: "'First principles' is a kind of physics way of looking at the world. And what that really means is that you boil things down to the most fundamental truths and then reason up from there. That takes a lot more mental energy." Reserve this approach for important problems where breakthrough solutions matter—when starting new ventures, making major strategic decisions, or confronting persistent challenges. For routine decisions, analogical reasoning remains efficient. The key is knowing which tool to apply when.

Embrace being wrong as part of the process. Musk stated: "You should take the approach that you're wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong." First principles thinking isn't about being certain you're right—it's about grounding reasoning in verifiable fundamentals rather than unexamined assumptions. Actively seek feedback to test whether your fundamental truths are accurate and whether your upward reasoning holds. This intellectual humility, combined with physics-based rigor, enables discovering what others miss.

## When fundamental truths reshape industries

The practical benefits of first principles thinking manifest in measurable competitive advantages. Across Musk's companies, this methodology consistently delivers 40-99% cost reductions: SpaceX achieved 76% lower launch costs, Tesla cut battery costs by 56-75%, Boring Company reduced tunnel costs by 90-99%, and manufacturing innovations like the Giga Press cut production costs by 40% while reducing time by 90%. These aren't incremental improvements—they're order-of-magnitude transformations that restructure entire industries.

Speed advantages compound over time. The Giga Press reduces Model Y rear section manufacturing from 1-2 hours to 3-5 minutes—enabling higher production volumes with less capital investment. SpaceX's vertical integration allows rapid iteration, with engineers solving problems in hours rather than the weeks required when coordinating multiple contractors. Boring Company's continuous operation could eventually dig miles per day versus weeks per mile for traditional methods. This acceleration effect emerges directly from eliminating unnecessary complexity identified through first principles analysis.

Market dominance follows cost leadership. SpaceX grew from zero to 60-70% of global commercial launch market share by 2020, forcing competitors like ULA to restructure and cut costs by 50% just to remain viable. Tesla's battery cost advantages enabled mass-market electric vehicles years before traditional automakers, establishing brand dominance and technology leadership. **The Giga Press innovation spread to Toyota, GM, Volvo, and VW within years**—validation that Musk's first principles approach identified genuinely superior solutions rather than merely different ones.

Beyond individual companies, first principles thinking reshapes what's possible at societal scale. SpaceX's cost reductions made commercial space stations, satellite internet constellations, and Mars colonization economically plausible rather than science fiction. Tesla's battery innovations accelerated the global electric vehicle transition by a decade. Boring Company's tunnel cost reductions could enable three-dimensional urban transportation networks. Neuralink's high-density brain-computer interfaces—using 3,072 electrodes versus traditional systems with 10-100—may restore mobility and communication to paralyzed individuals. **Each breakthrough emerged from questioning whether accepted limitations were physical necessities or merely historical conventions.**

## Conclusion: The physics of breakthrough thinking

First principles thinking represents more than a problem-solving technique—it's a systematic methodology for achieving what others consider impossible by refusing to accept that historical precedent determines future possibility. Musk's consistent application across aerospace, automotive, infrastructure, and neurotechnology demonstrates that 2,000-year-old Aristotelian reasoning remains the most powerful innovation tool available. The pattern repeats: identify conventional wisdom, break down to fundamental physical or mathematical truths, rebuild solutions from those foundations. The results consistently show order-of-magnitude improvements that transform entire industries.

The methodology's power lies in revealing that most "inevitable" costs and constraints are actually accumulated inefficiencies and unexamined assumptions. When rockets "must" cost $65 million but materials cost $1.3 million, when batteries "must" cost $600/kWh but materials cost $80/kWh, when tunnels "must" cost $1 billion per mile but fundamental physics allows 99% reduction—these gaps represent opportunities for anyone willing to question basic premises. Musk's genius isn't superhuman intelligence but systematic application of reasoning from fundamental truths rather than copying existing approaches with minor variations.

The path forward for anyone seeking breakthrough results involves three commitments: First, develop comfort with intellectual discomfort—first principles thinking requires far more mental energy than following established patterns. Second, cultivate genuine curiosity about why things are the way they are versus accepting surface explanations. Third, maintain willingness to be spectacularly wrong while pursuing spectacularly ambitious goals, using data and feedback to iterate toward less wrong understanding. As Musk demonstrated across multiple industries, the gap between what people consider impossible and what physics actually permits creates the largest opportunities for transformation. The question isn't whether first principles thinking works—the question is whether you're willing to think hard enough to apply it.
