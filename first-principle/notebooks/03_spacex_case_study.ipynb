    "\n",
    "In 2002, Elon Musk wanted to send experiments to Mars to reignite public interest in space exploration. When he approached aerospace manufacturers for quotes, he received shocking prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **US manufacturers**: $65 million per rocket\n",
    "- **Russian ICBMs**: $8-20 million (still prohibitively expensive)\n",

    "The aerospace industry's accepted truth: **\"Historically, all rockets have been expensive, so therefore, in the future, all rockets will be expensive.\"**\n",

    "This reasoning pattern is pure analogy: past = future, without examining underlying causes.\n",
    "\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "- Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys\n",
    "- Titanium\n",
    "- Copper\n",

    "When he checked commodity market prices for these materials, he discovered they cost approximately **$1.3 million** for a rocket.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. The 98% Rule\n",
    "When materials cost 2% and the product costs 100%, the 98% represents inefficiency opportunity—not fundamental requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Question Every 'Standard'\n",
    "\"Aerospace-grade,\" \"medical-grade,\" \"enterprise-grade\"—these often mean \"expensive by convention\" rather than \"required by physics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Vertical Integration as Strategy\n",
    "When contractor markups dominate costs, bringing manufacturing in-house can yield order-of-magnitude improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. The Airplane Analogy\n",
    "Reusability seems obvious in retrospect, but required questioning the fundamental assumption that rockets must be disposable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Validate with Experts\n",
    "Musk didn't just theorize—he held Saturday meetings with aerospace engineers to ensure no physical constraints were overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Iterate Based on Results\n",
    "SpaceX had multiple failures before success. First principles thinking reduces risk but doesn't eliminate it—iteration is essential."
