    "## What is First Principles Thinking?\n",
    "\n",
    "**First principles thinking** is a reasoning methodology where you break down complex problems to their most fundamental truths—basic propositions or assumptions that cannot be deduced from anything else—and then reason upward from those fundamentals to construct new solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Origin: 2,000 Years of Wisdom\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach originated with **Aristotle**, who defined a first principle as *\"the first basis from which a thing is known\"*—a foundational truth that cannot be derived from any other proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Application: Elon Musk's Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Elon Musk articulated this methodology clearly in his 2013 TED Talk:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"I think there's a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning... boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters: Order-of-Magnitude Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies applying first principles thinking have achieved extraordinary results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SpaceX**: 76% reduction in launch costs\n",
    "- **Tesla**: 56% reduction in battery costs\n",
    "- **Boring Company**: 90-99% reduction in tunnel costs\n",
    "- **Giga Press**: 40% manufacturing cost reduction, 90% time reduction\n",
