    "## Why Philosophical Grounding Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the ancient foundations prevents three common mistakes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Confusing Assumptions with First Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad**: \"Customers want low prices\" (assumption about preferences)\n",
    "**Good**: \"Customers prefer more value for less cost\" (economic fundamental)\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction matters because assumptions can be wrong, but true first principles hold universally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Stopping Too Soon\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insufficient**: \"We need a website\"\n",
    "**Better**: \"We need to display information to customers\"\n",
    "**First Principle**: \"Customers need information to make purchase decisions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep asking \"why\" until you reach something that cannot be reduced further (Aristotle's criterion).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Ignoring Physical or Mathematical Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unrealistic**: \"We can make batteries with infinite energy density\"\n",
    "**First Principles Check**: Thermodynamics sets maximum theoretical limits\n",
    "**Realistic**: \"We can approach theoretical limits more closely than current technology\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Descartes' systematic doubt helps: if physics or math contradicts your reasoning, you haven't reached true first principles."
