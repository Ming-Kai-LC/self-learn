# First Principles Thinking: From Ancient Philosophy to Modern Innovation

## Project Overview

This comprehensive educational project teaches Elon Musk's systematic approach to breakthrough innovation through first principles thinking—a 2,000-year-old reasoning methodology that has enabled SpaceX, Tesla, and other companies to achieve 40-99% cost reductions and transform entire industries.

Through hands-on Jupyter notebooks with real-world case studies and practical exercises, you'll learn to:
- Break down complex problems to their fundamental truths
- Question conventional wisdom systematically
- Build innovative solutions from foundational principles
- Apply this methodology to your own challenges

**Module 08: Building Your Semantic Tree** ⭐⭐
Master Musk's knowledge framework: understand trunk/branch/leaf relationships and how to build foundational knowledge systematically.

### Practice (Modules 09-10) - 6-8 hours

**Module 09: Practice Projects with Templates** ⭐⭐⭐
Complete guided practice problems across multiple domains with structured templates and feedback mechanisms.

**Module 10: Final Project - Your First Principles Analysis** ⭐⭐⭐
