    "## Introduction: Why Position Sizing Matters More Than Entry/Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shocking Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Position sizing determines 90% of your long-term returns** - not your entry timing, not your exit strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two traders, same strategy, different position sizing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trader A** (No position sizing):\n",
    "- Buys RM10,000 worth every trade\n",
    "- Stop-loss varies: 3% to 10%\n",
    "- Risk varies: RM300 to RM1,000 per trade\n",
    "- One 10% loss = RM1,000 (needs 3-4 wins to recover)\n",
    "- **Result**: Inconsistent, high stress, eventual blow-up\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trader B** (2% rule):\n",
    "- Risks exactly 2% per trade (RM200 on RM10,000 account)\n",
    "- Adjusts position size based on stop distance\n",
    "- Wide stop = smaller position\n",
    "- Tight stop = larger position\n",
    "- **Result**: Consistent risk, steady growth, survives bad streaks\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Professional Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional traders:\n",
    "1. ✅ **First**: Calculate position size\n",
    "2. ✅ **Second**: Find entry\n",
    "3. ✅ **Third**: Set stop-loss\n",
    "4. ✅ **Fourth**: Execute trade\n",
    "\n",
    "Amateur traders:\n",
    "1. ❌ Find entry\n",
    "2. ❌ Buy as much as they can afford\n",
    "3. ❌ Hope it goes up\n",
    "4. ❌ Set stop-loss (maybe)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Malaysian Market Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Bursa Malaysia retail investor mistakes**:\n",
    "- Putting 20-50% of capital in one trade\n",
    "- No stop-losses (\"I'll average down\")\n",
    "- Overtrading low-conviction setups\n",
    "- Revenge trading after losses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Professional approach for Malaysia**:\n",
    "- 2% risk per trade maximum\n",
    "- Position size based on stop distance\n",
    "- Core holdings: 40% of portfolio\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Kelly Criterion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kelly Criterion** calculates the mathematically optimal position size to maximize long-term growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Kelly Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Kelly % = (Win Rate × Avg Win - Loss Rate × Avg Loss) / Avg Win\n",
    "\n",
    "Or simplified:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelly % = W - [(1 - W) / R]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **W** = Win rate (probability of winning)\n",
    "- **R** = Win/Loss ratio (average win / average loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy statistics**:\n",
    "- Win rate: 60%\n",
    "- Average win: 5%\n",
    "- Average loss: 3%\n",
    "- Win/Loss ratio: 5% / 3% = 1.67\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kelly Calculation**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Kelly % = 0.60 - [(1 - 0.60) / 1.67]\n",
    "        = 0.60 - [0.40 / 1.67]\n",
    "        = 0.60 - 0.24\n",

    "### The Problem with Full Kelly\n",

    "## 6. Drawdown Management Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Drawdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawdown** = Peak-to-trough decline in account value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Account peak: RM50,000\n",
    "- Current value: RM45,000\n",
    "- Drawdown: RM5,000 or 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Drawdown Management Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every trader experiences drawdowns**:\n",
    "- Even profitable strategies have losing streaks\n",
    "- Market conditions change\n",
    "- Psychological pressure increases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without a protocol**:\n",
    "- Panic selling\n",
    "- Revenge trading\n",
    "- Position size increases (trying to recover fast)\n",
    "- Account destruction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawdown Management Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level 1: 10% Drawdown (Yellow Alert)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions**:\n",
    "- [ ] Review all open positions\n",
    "- [ ] Tighten stop-losses\n",
    "- [ ] Reduce position sizes by 25%\n",
    "- [ ] Only take highest-confidence setups\n",
    "- [ ] Review recent trades for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level 2: 15% Drawdown (Orange Alert)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions**:\n",
    "- [ ] Close all losing positions\n",
    "- [ ] Reduce position sizes by 50%\n",
    "- [ ] Only trade highest-conviction setups\n",
    "- [ ] Take 3-5 day break from trading\n",
    "- [ ] Review strategy thoroughly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level 3: 20% Drawdown (Red Alert)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions**:\n",
    "- [ ] STOP TRADING immediately\n",
    "- [ ] Close all positions\n",
    "- [ ] Take 2-4 week break\n",
    "- [ ] Complete strategy review\n",
    "- [ ] Consider paper trading to regain confidence\n",
    "- [ ] Seek mentorship/guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recovery Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**After a drawdown**:\n",
    "1. Start with reduced position sizes (50%)\n",
    "2. Prove consistency for 10+ trades\n",
    "3. Gradually increase to full size\n",
    "4. Never try to \"make it back fast\"\n",

    "### Malaysian Market Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical drawdowns on Bursa Malaysia**:\n",
    "- 5-10%: Normal, don't overreact\n",
