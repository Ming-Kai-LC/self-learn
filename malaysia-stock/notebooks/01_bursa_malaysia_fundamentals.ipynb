    "\n",
    "Excellent work! You now understand how Bursa Malaysia operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Key Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trading Hours**: Dual sessions (9:00-12:30, 14:30-17:00 MYT)\n",
    "2. **Settlement**: T+2 system (2 business days after trade)\n",
    "3. **Market Tiers**: Main Market (established), ACE Market (growth), LEAP Market (SMEs)\n",
    "4. **Transaction Costs**: ~0.15-0.25% total per trade (brokerage + stamp duty + clearing)\n",
    "5. **Tax Advantages**: **ZERO capital gains tax** on listed stocks!\n",
    "6. **FBM KLCI**: 30 largest companies, +9.4% in 2024\n",

    "\n",
    "### 💰 Remember: Zero Capital Gains Tax!\n",

    "This is Malaysia's biggest advantage. Every ringgit of profit from stock trading is yours to keep (no capital gains tax). This compounds significantly over time!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Trading Cost Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "For a RM5,000 trade:\n",
    "- One-way costs: ~RM8-9 (0.17%)\n",
    "- Round-trip costs: ~RM16-18 (0.34%)\n",
    "- **You need at least 0.34% gain just to break even**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why frequent trading (day trading) is challenging - costs add up quickly!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 02: Data Collection with yfinance**, you'll learn:\n",
