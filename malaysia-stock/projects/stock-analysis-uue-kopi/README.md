## Risk Warnings

### ACE Market Considerations

Both stocks are on **ACE Market**, which means:
- ⚠️ **Higher volatility** than Main Market stocks
- ⚠️ **Lower liquidity** - wider bid-ask spreads
- ⚠️ **Higher risk** - younger companies with less track record
- ⚠️ **Potential for high returns** but also significant losses

### Investment Risks

- **Past performance does not guarantee future results**
- **Always start with paper trading** - test your strategy first
- **Use only risk capital** - money you can afford to lose
- **Consult licensed advisors** before making investment decisions
- **This is educational** - not financial advice

### Data Quality

- Verify all data sources independently
- Cross-check financial statements with official Bursa filings
- Be aware of data delays in free data sources
- Validate technical signals across multiple sources
