    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Calculate **mean, median, and mode** for stock prices and explain when to use each\n",
    "2. Understand **why averaging reduces noise** in stock price data\n",
    "3. Calculate **weighted averages** and explain why they matter in technical analysis\n",
    "4. Explain the **mathematical foundation** of Simple Moving Averages (SMA)\n",
    "5. Apply these concepts to real Malaysian stock data\n",

    "**Averages are the backbone of technical indicators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every indicator uses some form of averaging:\n",
    "- **Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)** → Direct application of mean and weighted mean\n",
    "- **RSI** → Averages positive and negative returns\n",
    "- **MACD** → Difference between two moving averages\n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands** → Standard deviation around a moving average\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the mathematics of averages helps you:\n",
    "- Know **when** moving averages give reliable signals\n",
    "- Understand **why** EMAs react faster than SMAs\n",
    "- Choose the **right averaging period** for your trading style\n",
