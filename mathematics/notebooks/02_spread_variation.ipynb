    "\n",
    "**Difficulty**: ⭐ (Beginner)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: \n",
    "- Module 00: Introduction and Stock Returns\n",
    "- Module 01: Averages and Central Tendency\n",
    "- Basic understanding of mean/average\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Calculate **range, variance, and standard deviation** for stock prices\n",
    "2. Explain **why standard deviation measures risk** in trading\n",
    "3. Understand the **mathematical relationship** between variance and standard deviation\n",
    "4. Measure and compare **volatility** across different Malaysian stocks\n",
    "5. Explain the **mathematical foundation** of Bollinger Bands\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volatility is risk. Standard deviation is how we measure it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding spread and variation is crucial for:\n",
    "- **Risk Management** → Standard deviation tells you how much a stock typically moves\n",
    "- **Position Sizing** → Higher volatility = smaller position size\n",
    "- **Stop Loss Placement** → Use volatility to set appropriate stop distances\n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands** → Uses standard deviation to create dynamic support/resistance\n",
    "- **ATR (Average True Range)** → Another volatility measure we'll cover in Module 06\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent work! You've completed Module 02. Let's review:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**\n",
    "   - Formula: Maximum - Minimum\n",
    "   - Simple but limited (only uses 2 data points)\n",
    "   - Daily range = High - Low\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance**\n",
    "   - Average of squared deviations from mean\n",
    "   - Formula: $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$\n",
    "   - Units are squared (RM²) - hard to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation**\n",
    "   - Square root of variance\n",
    "   - Same units as original data (RM)\n",
    "   - **The primary measure of risk in trading**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Volatility**\n",
    "   - Standard deviation of returns (not prices)\n",
    "   - Standardized measure across all stocks\n",
    "   - Higher volatility = Higher risk\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule)**\n",
    "   - 68% of data within ±1 std dev\n",
    "   - 95% of data within ±2 std dev\n",
    "   - 99.7% of data within ±3 std dev\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bollinger Bands Foundation**\n",
    "   - Middle: 20-day SMA\n",
    "   - Upper: SMA + 2×StdDev\n",
    "   - Lower: SMA - 2×StdDev\n",
    "   - Based on 95% confidence interval\n",
    "\n",
    "### How This Connects to Technical Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you learned applies directly to:\n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands** (Module 06): Uses SMA ± 2×StdDev\n",
    "- **ATR (Average True Range)** (Module 06): Uses range for volatility\n",
    "- **Position Sizing**: Adjust position size based on volatility\n",
    "- **Stop Loss Placement**: Use ATR or std dev for stop distances\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: Volatility determines how much to risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 03: Percentages, Ratios, and Changes**, you'll learn:\n",
    "- Percentage calculations in trading context\n",
    "- Rate of Change (ROC) mathematics\n",
    "- Normalizing values to 0-100 scale\n",
    "- Foundation for RSI indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Module 03, try:\n",
    "1. Calculate volatility for other Malaysian stocks\n",
    "2. Compare volatility across different sectors (banking, healthcare, telecom)\n",
    "3. Identify volatility clustering in your data\n",
    "4. Experiment with different Bollinger Band settings (10-day, 50-day, etc.)"
